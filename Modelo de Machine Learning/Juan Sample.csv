I think it depends on what you order here too. Their serving sizes are quite large and can easily be two meals, making great leftovers.

We ordered over $50 worth of food through their online ordering. Part of our order was a pint of vegetable lo mein and we ordered a chicken and broccoli combination. The online drop down menu for the combination had rice options, but in the special instructions we asked for the rice to be subbed out with vegetable lo mein instead. A few minutes after submitting the order, we got a phone call from the restaurant. A girl stated that they were out of vegetable lo mein for the combo platter. I asked if what that meant regarding the pint we had ordered. She said she didn't know, her manager just told her to call and say they were out of it for the combination platter. I said ""are you out of stock or is it just not an option for the combination?"" she said she needed to check and put me on hold. I sat on hold for over 10 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back, to which the line picked up but no one said anything and I sat there saying hello while I heard them talking in the background for over 5 minutes. I hung up again and called back and at that point they just picked up and hung up. I got in my car to drive over to see what was going on with my order. Again, it was $50 worth of food. When I got there, a man came out, I'm guessing who was the manager and asked me what I needed. I said you guys called me and said there was an issue with my order but never spoke to me regarding a resolution. He basically said, you can't choose lo mein for the combination, you have to choose rice.  Ok! I totally get that. But why couldn't I be told that instead of being lied to by being told you were out of stock? He just said he couldn't talk to me earlier because he was cooking then I kept bothering them by calling back. Then told me since I had a problem they aren't fulfilling my order and they are just refunding me. Fine by me. I will never be going there again.","2024-09-12T20:31:36.776706Z"
