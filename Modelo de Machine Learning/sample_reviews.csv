Pacific Grove,Massachusetts,Wilmington,Lynn,4,"Very, very good meals. 13 in our party and all the food was wonderful. The only drawback was the people that ordered sushi had to wait a long time. There was 1 employee making sushi and a fair amount of customers there. We ended up taking the sushi to go. Other than that, great meals, generous portions and attentive employees."

Li's Asian Cuisine,Georgia,Marietta,Alyson Taylor,4,"Been eating at Li's now for over 10 years. It's a little mom-and-pop Asian food restaurant with great menu variety. The food always tastes delicious, although I've never tried their sushi. The only reason I give this place four stars instead of five is the wait time... if the restaurant is mostly empty then you usually get your food in a decent amount of time, but unfortunately they're just not equipped (or staffed) to handle a lunch or dinner rush very efficiently. Still, you can bet I'm going back for their pineapple chicken stir fry."

Nothing too out of the ordinary, but all the standards like lo main, fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, crab Rangoon. Made to order hibachi is a nice addition. Sushi included in meal too, but the variety is limited. Only real complaint is that during peak hours it is so busy that the staff can‚Äôt keep the place as clean as it should be. Sticky tables, ,easy bathrooms, plates not
Cleared often....but over all a good value when you want to pig out!"
Chinah,New Jersey,Jersey City,Richa Gupta Bitta,2,"Sorry but i didn‚Äôt find the taste close to authentic Chinese food. Been lived in China SG HK for over a decade, i wonder when will i get a real mapo tofu. Brown rice is hard or undercooked. But good for a taste change once in a while."

Mr Eggroll Chinese Restaurant,Georgia,Snellville,Yvette Young,1,"Ordered to to go lunch meals. Pork lo-main and sesame chicken both with egg roll and won ton soup. Pork strips were old this was obvious because of how hard and dried out they were. The won-ton was in water honestly it all was horrible. Called Mr Eggroll to complain and was placed on hold for an excessive amount of time. Called from another line after I told the guy how bad the lunches were he said to come back and they would exchange it, I told him they could drive to my house and exchange it. He hung up me. This isn't the first bad experience we've had with them. But it is our LAST..3 strikes your out!

Fail- in food quailty
Fail- in customer service
Fail-  in cleanliness of the dining room restaurant  area, can only imagine how bad the kitchen is.

The restaurant owner specially printed the price on the menu in gold, and the font was very small, and it was easy for the customer to read the wrong price.
The quality of the dish is OK, but it is not a special dish, it is not worth recommending, it may be more suitable for the American middle class.

Sun Garden,South Carolina,Inman,Lacie Gosnell,2,This place needs to be shut down. I have came here numerous times and have been disappointed each time. On the buffet the food is always cold and tastes stale. The owners children are always running around being very loud and often leave them to clean up and serve drinks and such. The place also looks dirty and dingy. I do not recommend to anyone. I don't even know how they are still in business.

I posted that last year. Since then, the ownership must have switched. After sushi was introduced, the regular menu for was good for a few months but has drastically changed. We would order once a week, no lie, and now we haven't been back but 3-4 times in a year. The ingredients are cheaper, the sauces have no flavor, and the portions have grown smaller. It's a shame because I live very close to this place and loved to come here."

This place is the best around. All of the other Chinese joints in this area taste too bland. Food is finished quickly (10-15mins for almost every takeout order) and they have Pint/Quart size options, which for some reason is rare to find in MA. So many other places force you into one size, which is always huge. Will be coming back!"

Making LoMein with Rice Noodles and cooking Generals Tsos Chicken without the breading as well as other things.  We truly appreciate your help.  Thank you very much.

My wife and I order from here quite often.  They do a fantastic job on the Shrimp with Garlic Sauce.  My son is a huge fan of the Generals Chicken.  The family that runs the place are quite nice, always polite and seem to really care if you enjoy the food.  We enjoy the long mein and one of my favorites are the fried wantons dipped in duck sauce.  They are crunchy and have a savory meat inside.  Combined with the duck sauce it combines salty and sweet.

China Delight,South Carolina,Boiling Springs,Chichi Williford,2,"I normally don't leave reviews but I had to come on here to let people know that this restaurant is just not it. It was the only restaurant open on the forth of july and I was craving chinese food. I ordered a steak and teriyaki chicken blend w/ pork fried rice and an eggroll. The meat was not only bland w/ very little sauce and seasoning but it had a gooy, gritty texture that was very unpleasant. The rice was dry and the eggroll had little to no filling. Customer service was good that's why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 but definitly won't be going back when there are way better options in the area."

My review from 2 yrs ago: The food was good. This is a typical Chinese carry out type of place. Nothing fancy. There is probably better places but they are all 20 min away from my house and this one is up the street. The sauce was a little bland but I added some siracha on my food and it was great. Not overly greasy crab Rangoon and their sweet and sour sauce was fine. No issues with ordering over the phone. Would eat here again."

Asian Chef Express,North Carolina,King,Joel,1,"I hate posting bad reviews, but this is possibly the worst most flavorless Chinese food I've ever had. Seeing all of the reviews tells me the poor people in King doesn't get out much, and don't understand what good Chinese food is. I ordered bourbon chicken and some kind of Sriracha chicken and both tasted nearly the same. A very watery gross sauce was smothered over both. The noodles are the very worst I've ever had, they reminded me of spaghetti squash noodles, very dry and no taste. I was hoping this would be a place similar to panda express, but not even close."

Salem Lowe,Massachusetts,Salem,Diane Mahoney,4,"The original and the best. The fact that out of Towners don't 'get it', and, admittedly it's not the greastest chop suey (really, it's Chicken Chow Mein) in the world, doesn't detract from our love for those Chop Suey Sandwiches! Get it wrapped in paper, take your spork and dig a hole half way into the chopsuey, then squirt soy sauce in the hole.....the old school and best way to eat it! Also, I tried the Tendersteak sandwich for the first time today. It wasn't bad, tasted like potroast with gravy to me. I will stick with the chop suey, thank you! üòä BTW, their chicken wings are great but I was disappointed with the fries. They used to have crinkle cut, which I love, but now regular fat shoestrings. Perfect day, early in the season, no crowds!"

The menu is extensive featuring a large number of authentic Chinese dishes. They have ""American Chinese"" options as well. Everything is delicious. You cannot go wrong with anything. Really fun to go with a group of friends and try a lot of things. The General Tso's chicken, chicken/beef/shrimp with broccoli, and all the fried rices are superb. Food is not greasy, but rather well seasoned and down right tasty. If you're not in the mood to dine-in then order a meal to take out. I travel all the way from Harlem for the food. Oh, and, AMEX is accpeted."
Golden Wok,Virginia,Roanoke,Jefferey Millard,2,"My sister recently bought her and I some General Taos chicken from Golden Wok. This place is located next to the Food Lion that closed down at Brookside. The General Taos was too sweet for me. My sister didn‚Äôt really care for the owner, Rick. She said he came off as annoying. After we ate we asked some friends what they think of this place and heard mixed reviews. This place seems to have atleast a few regular customers. However, we heard several people say this place was terrible, and they didn‚Äôt like the owner, Rick. From the way people talk, it seems hardly anyone likes Rick. One of our friends told us several people ignore Rick, and also think he‚Äôs annoying, like my sister."

Panda Express,New Jersey,Sicklerville,Stephen Cann,2,"I am a huge fan of Panda and was so excited when they opened up near me. Unfortunately, this is a very poorly run/inconsistent one. Numerous times before 7 PM they have run out of appetizers/various sides/etc. The people taking the orders at the drive thru can be either fantastic, fast and very cheerful, or sullen, extremely slow, and very rude. To the staff who have been awesome, kudos! Hope more of you are hired here."
The Bao Shoppe,New York,New York,Raymond Chen,5,"The Bao Shoppe easily has the best bubble tea in Astoria - lots of ""toppings"" selections, including my personal fave, the popping boba.  The regular tapioca is soft and full of tea flavor.  Infinitely better than the other Astoria bubble tea places.

Secondly, the food is packed with flavor.  I've tried a few of the bao, with one of my favorites being the Texan. The scallion pancake with marinated beef and veggies, pickle, and hoisin is seriously good.

This is a really welcome addition to the neighborhood!  Go here and get your snack on ASAP."
Great Wall,Connecticut,Wethersfield,Elvis Palombizio,5,"I'd agree that this has the best take out in Wethersfield I've tried so far for American Chinese. Everything I tried had a lighter, fresher taste about it that made me forget it came from a 12' hole in the wall.

If you're looking for good take out in the Wethersfield area, look no further."
New Great Wall,New Jersey,Bayville,Elisabeth,1,"Honestly one of the worst Chinese takeouts I‚Äôve ever had. All of these Chinese takeouts are pretty much the same, they buy their food from the same places, cheapest possible meats and veggies they can get..so of course it all tastes the same. The reviews are from ppl who don‚Äôt know good food. They most likely can‚Äôt cook and live on nasty cheap ass takeout. Upbly need to eat here once to know it‚Äôs one of the worst.  I‚Äôve had good and great Chines food and this place is definitely not it."

Asian Cafe,Maryland,Frederick,Mars Hall,1,I use to LOVE this place. But for some reason their fried rice is tasting very old and hard almost to the point that it is very hard to eat it due to the stale taste. I wish that they got back to their old food. I use to eat here once every 2-3 weeks or so. Today will be my last time. I would rather not pay around 10 bucks for old rice.

The orange chicken with chicken fried rice, was delicious .the chicken was fresh and the amount of sauce it had was great. With a little bit of crispiness to top it off the orange chicken made for a great  meal .

I also enjoyed the general tso chicken with chicken fried rice. They make really nice size pieces of chicken inside there general tso chicken ,very meaty. The sauce and a little bit of crispiness with there chicken is really good. Hands down has to be one of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever had.plus they make some really good chicken wings. Crispy but not hard,and meaty .all of that with some duck sauce and soy sauce, with some hot mustard.

The delivery guy was really cool and had a great since of humor. The only thing he forgot   to put the hot mustard in the bag.but shout out to him for his delivery customer service to me were I was at ,celebrating a very big day in my life."

Tin Drum Asian Kitchen - Atlantic Station,Georgia,Atlanta,ddavuluri1,4,"Located in the center of Atlantic station. The perfect dining spot for when you go shopping. They have a very nice outdoor patio, to enjoy on nicer days. The tables on the inside are this light brown, wooden looking tables. I suppose to go with the theme of Thailand. Aside from that, there isn't much to the decor. The service is pretty good. You order at the register, receive a number, pick up utensils, and your food is brought out to you in about 10-15 minutes. They are very quick about taking the order and bringing the food out. The menu is well priced, the lunch entrees are about $9-10, and you receive a copious amount. You can definitely have enough left overs for another meal. The food is delicious and you can have it made to your taste if you ask. My favorite dish is the chicken pad thai, it's a noodle dish with some peanuts on top, it's absolutely delicious! Also, I'm a sucked for their Thai Iced Tea and I love that now you can make your own Thai Tea, because then you can alter it to your preference. Also, you can get refills! This is a great spot for a quick lunch, to meet with a friend and catch up, or even just to satiate that hunger while shopping!"

The food and soup was awesome, the gravy needs alittle help, maybe C,P,B, stock with flour instead of corn starch, alittle more flavor, this was the first time this year of covid 19 we have  visited, I wish them well but would have to talk with the management first before another visit.

I'm told there are distinct branches of Chinese cuisine, and this place features one that we don't get exposure to. The decor can be considered ""fancy,"" but that may not justify the higher prices. Food was presented well and taste was okay. We tried to order dishes that were specialties. Pork belly, chicken clay pot, whole fish, sauteed greens with shiitakes, xiao long bao - nothing was bad but it didn't strike me as particularly memorable.

Wild Ginger,New York,Rockville Centre,Cole T,1,"I came here with my family one night. The sign says last seating at 9:45 p.m. We got here at 9:12 p.m. we were advised that the only way we can be seated is, if we ordered quickly due to the kitchen closing. We barely had time to take our jackets off when the waitress came. We told them we have never been to this restaurant but I ordered very quickly my daughter was next and was told she could not have what's on the menu. She would  have to take what's left in the kitchen because the kitchen is closing. We were very annoyed at this point and proceeded to leave the restaurant.
I don't understand why they let us in, who pays for food they didn't order or want.  Maybe they should change the sign to no menu ordering after 9 p.m. orders based on kitchen stock."

Ten Ren Tea & Ginseng Co.,New York,Brooklyn,Dennis D,5,"Ten Ren was my first!! And to this day, I still think their boba is still top notch compared to everyone else.

I know the bubble tea business is hitting an all time high. Everyone's doing a 50% off deal. However, Ten Ren is a place I still go to even though I have to pay full price. Their tea is just delicious. You can actually taste the TEA!!!

Other newer businesses over saturate the flavor and you can barely taste any tea.

They are a little pricier, but the quality is higher. This is a case where you get what you pay for. On a date, I would definitely stop by here for tea. To quench my thirst while I'm out with my boys, I normally just stop at Quicklys or T Baar to get the best bang for the buck.

Ten Ren...keep up the good work!"

Do not go looking for crab legs, it is a fraud, a hoax, you will see 3 legs throughout the night, I was with my family for 20 minutes waiting for them to fill the container and in the end there was so much disrespect, lack of customer service, that we left. My little brother saw how they brought a tray with 6 legs, we were 6 people in line, what a bad time.

It has the same quality as any buffet I've been to even though this is take out only. I ordered the General Tso lunch which came with a side of pork fried rice, egg drop soup and I ordered a second side an egg roll. Everything was exactly what I expected and very tasty. I think its pretty harsh with Covid already hurting restaurants to leave a poor review. In fact if I didn't like New China I just wouldn't return and would avoid leaving any comment at all. Cheers"

At a last resort I figured the dessert couldn't be that bad (who can mess up on desserts?!) I was disappointed to find even that felt like styrofoam in my mouth..

The price is absolutely outrageous! I went with a date and it was $30 for the two of us. We had both ordered water, and just got the buffet dinner. We left hungry and very disappointed.

The two women standing at the front desk were unprofessional as they just gossiped right in front of us as we checked out, and our server hardly ever refilled our drinks!

Take your business elsewhere! Inakaya is right down the road from here, you will find great Asain food, great prices, and great service!"

My food had been sitting waiting for who knows how long. I asked if the food was cold and she touched the bag and said it was hot. I brought the food home and 75% of it was not what I ordered. The food that we did order was terrible! The Egg Foo Young was burnt to a crisp and greasy and of course, everything else was cold and tasted bad (except the Bourbon chicken)! I called to speak to them and the woman kept screaming at me how busy she was and hanging up on me. She hung up three times! DON'T GO HERE!!!"

One nice feature is that they have a large version and a small version of the same dish.  Choosing the smaller dish can allow you to have more dishes without spending too much.  Even for small dish, when I ask for two, I need to wrap them up and take home at the end."

China Grill,New York,New York,Derrick Miller,4,"Great food! No big on Chinese food, but this one is really good. Not too pricey either."
Do Eat Chinese Food,New York,Mt Sinai,James D,5,"This is a solid neighborhood Chinese place. What makes it 5 Stars is that can make most of the dishes gluten free. I have eaten here 4 or 5 times and I have had no reaction at all. You need to specify gluten free when you order, and they will sub in Gluten Free Soy Sauce, for example. It does not work for every dish, breaded dishes are still a no-go, but there is a pretty good selection. As far as I know, they don't have a separate kitchen, so they are Gluten Friendly, not gluten free.

The best dishes are on the ""Real Chinese"" part of the menu. I have had the shredded pork, the cabbage, and the string beans. They were all very good. I agree with some of the other reviews, the fried rice is a little bland. That being said, before I found this place, it had been 6 years since I had takeout Chinese food.  I would give it 10 stars for that alone.

It is not the objectively best Chinese I have every had, but it is far from bad. It is the best Gluten Free Chinese I have ever had and I have not gotten sick! Now if they can only figure out how to make Gluten Free bagels taste good..."

Jin Jin Chinese Buffet and Sushi,South Carolina,Spartanburg,Maria Gammill,1,The selection is average. The place is clean and of course the service is great because the tip is mandatory on the final bill. The crab ragoo is not sweet. The crawfish is really spicy and not enough flavor. The macaroni and cheese was mushy. The steamed shrimp was over cooked. The biscuits with seafood were delicious. The ice cream taste of cheap flavor. The crabs that were included in the dinner smelled pretty bad (I'm not sure if they are supposed to smell like that but i definitely didn't want to spend my night on the toilet ). They only had 4 types of sushi and the the one with fried chicken was extremely stale. The food is not fresh unless there is a rush. (Lunch/dinner). The price was around $10 per adult and different prices for the kids depending on their age. Our bill for 4 adults & 2 kid's was $61.13 with tip.

Hop Shing,Florida,Atlantic Beach,bebe liang,5,I ordered shrimp vegetable fried rice noodles and chicken vegetable fried noodle . It is so delicious ! I will definitely come back !
Michael & Ping's,New York,Brooklyn,Lady Ace,4,"Lapin and I came here on earlier in the week for a quick dinner. When, we arrived there a few tables occupied but still ample seating available. You place an order at the cashier and you either pick up your order or they deliver it to your table. I would recommend giving people cards to place on their table since, the cashier dropped our food on another person's table. Lapin ordered the General Tso's chicken, which had plump lightly coated white meat. The entree was delicious and Lapin cleared the entire dish out in five seconds. I ordered the Chicken and Broccoli, which was light and flavorful. My only qualm with my dish is that it lacked enough sauce. I ordered brown rice and when I mixed the little sauce it came with, my food was still a dry.  (This dish doesn't taste well after 1 - 2 days as leftovers, best bet either to eat all or order something else):) I like how the food was flavorful but light and didn't leave us feeling bloated or stuff. On a side note, it is definitely more expensive than your average Chinese takeout, but they also utilize healthier ingredients."

China Chef,South Carolina,Summerville,Briana Dederer,4,Overall a decent place for Chinese food. Their dumpling sauce has a kick and I loved it. The lo mein was not so great. But I'm a northerner so I'm super picky about Chinese food. The lo mein just wasnt as good as it should of been. It was super thick and a bit mushy but the rice and chicken and egg roll was pretty good. Not sure why people have said the place was dirty. It wasnt fancy that's for sure but it was definitely clean

Panda Express,New Jersey,Voorhees Township,Tierra Perez,3,"Love the food and service is on point. However, they give smaller portion sizes especially for the premium entrees. I ordered the Angus Steak and pretty much got 4 small pieces of what appeared to be overcooked steak and a ton of mushrooms and onions. I waited for a fresh order of sweet fire chicken just to get a small spoonful of tiny chicken pieces with one large piece and 2 pieces of pineapple, no peppers. The one in Cherry Hill is better, and gives decent portions."

Usually there's this nice young woman who greets you with a smile before taking your order. Unfortunately tonight and the last time I was unpleasantly waited upon by a younger woman. Both times when I walked in she looked at me and turned around and said something to one of the cooks. And then of course they both start laughing. And she managed to avoid eye contact as I waited 20 minutes for food that I usually wait 10 minutes for! If I ever get the rare urge to have Chinese food, I just might order out from somewhere else."

Taste of China,North Carolina,Beaufort,Damien Christopher,1,"Pretty bad... ordered a PuPu Platter and a honey chicken dinner ""combo"". Normally a combo comes with soup, appitizee, egg roll... here it's just an egg roll. The PuPu platter is shown as having fantail shrimp, it was the small ones instead. The ribs and teriyaki steak was shriveled and dried, looking more like jerky. The checked wings were dry and almost black with oil tgat needed to be changed. All this was $20+ the honey chicken was okay, but not worth ever going back. Just sad and unappatizing. Also, I did take out and they didn't put any cutlery or napkins, nor duck or soy sauce. Waited 15 minutes for them to prepare, and it was freezing in there... no heat in 40¬∞ weather."

108 Food Dried Hot Pot,New York,New York,Vignesh M,5,"I absolutely loved my dried hotpot. If you have ever had hotpot, you are not sure if have undercooked it in which case it's unhygienic to eat it or overcooked it in which case it doesn't taste so good. The dried hotpot takes care of all that. I ordered mild spicy and it was pretty good. My friend who does not handle spice so well could have used a little less spice I suppose. However they were announcing the order numbers in Chinese and we had to personally goto the counter to check if it was our order a couple of times. Seating is ample and location is pretty nice. It's good for groups of people as well."

The rice seemed over cooked, like almost soggy. And the rangoons...I love rangoons. Even if they aren't great from one place they are usually good. These rangoons were bad. They either cooked them too long or used dirty oil. They were a brown rather than tan and there were brown bits on them that looked like some of the inside that oozed out and burned onto them. I still tried 2 of them and they were no good, not even a little. I will never order fom here again."

Red Pepper Sichuan Bistro,Maryland,Towson,Alon Seal,5,"Fantastic food for a change of pace from the normal / routine Chinese menu. The offering is deep w regional favorites, with liberal use of spicy hot oil and chilies.

We did an online order, and they got everything right. They accept diverse payment options.

The Crawfish has good flavor, not too spicy. The left over broth is worth saving for jazzing up instant noodles.
Chicken w Szechuan Pepper, fried prawns w spicy salt, and spicy wonton are all winners.
Sweet and sour cucumber is served cold and is a  really great appetizer.
The home style beef tenderloin is very home style, indeed. Be mindful if you don't like fat or silverskin, though. This isn't a Ruth's Chris tenderloin. It's home style.
The sister rabbit was a bit boney, but flavorful. Probably won't get that again.

Overall, üíØ would recommend, and so many other dishes to try."

China Moon,New Jersey,Piscataway,jessica sopretty,1,WORST PLACE EVERR!!! Placed my order at 12:45 and I had called 6 times over an hrs period. they just kept saying 2 min 2 min. Finally an hr and 20 mins later they finally get here to find the receipt said I owed them $17.59 when my total was $12.75. They added $1.00 gas fee and .89 tax. which brought my total to $14.64. I specificly told them the last phone call I didn't want my food if it was cold. She said ya ya 2 min okay and hung up!!! So I called them when I came inside and the lady hung up on me when I said I didn't want it and don't charge my card. I called back twice and no answer. Called from my cell no answer. Called from a friends phone and got an answer!!! She aid she would have someone call me back its been a half hr. Ill just dispute the transaction with my bank! AND NEVER CALL THEM AGAIN!!! PS: Receipts came at the same time!

Number 1 Restaurant,New Jersey,Rockaway,AJ Murch Jr,1,"Tried this place for lunch as a change of pace from getting a sub, and I'm extremely disappointed.  The beef was extremely chewey, the rice was obviously reheated (still had clumps of rice stuck together), and I couldn't even eat the egg roll.  It tasted like they tried to reheat it in the fryer when the oil wasn't hot enough, so it just tasted like it had been soaked in grease.  I'll never be going back here again."

So when you do try their food you will find that it is by far one of the best around. Get over the way they talk or act, it is not personal. Just their way of life...
I WOULD LIKE TO RETRACT MY ORIGINAL POST, The one above, the people that work there are by far the worst I've ever experienced in any job I've ever had, I mean ever...They want to pay you in rice (a free meal after a 10 to 12 hour work day) they try very hard to rip you off for money you earned in tips by various means, they resale food, YES THEY DO..I delivered for them so I know what I'm saying..Go on a delivery person does not want their order for whatever reason ie; did not have money or not what they ordered, I would return with the order, watch them put the rice back in the mix or even return an order and a new customer walk in place an order and watch them pull the chicken wings out of the bag I returned and put in the new customer's bag...I would swear to this in court. Believe it. . Yes I quit I cannot be a part of that....If I were anyone I would find some other place besides them..Yes some orders were left with customer and had to go and pu, not getting paid for 2nd trip...you have been warned...."

I understand if stuff is going on and you need to check your phone,  but you could be a little more discrete and not require me to yell across the room to get your attention for a refill. That's just had service."

Love picking out my own food for them to cook the way I want it and watch them do it. The egg drop soup is great! The rest of the buffet could be better managed. Food can sit there to long and they still serve it. I like  the atmosphere and clean the tables are kept. I will still go for the hibachi every now and again mainly for my kids.

No 1 Chinese Restaurant,Georgia,Blairsville,Donald Curtiss jr,5,I think that my wife and I have finally found our Asian buffet. This small town buffet is awesome. Food and service was very good. The sauces that they use were absolutely amazing. Very clean on our visit and that was right before they started to begin clean up. The older lady is absolutely the sweetest and makes you feel like you're at her house. I am a very picky person and kind of particular about my reviews. So this 5 stars is definitely well deserved.

Buffet City,Virginia,Virginia Beach,Carol Mekosh,1,"Total Disappointment!  The wait staff was rude from the start. It's a buffet so you don't expect a lot of customer service but when the waitress stands in the way of your party trying to get seated and then snatches the drink order from the hostess it's not a good start to her tip.  The food was limited and the green beans and chicken and broccoli looked warmed up. The cooked sushi was icebox cold.  When the waitress finally came back to check on us, we asked for drink refills.  She brought back water instead of Pepsi.  There was a language barrier and she seemed annoyed by us.  We were very disappointed and will NOT be coming back again.  The lack of customers on a Sunday evening should have been a sign."

Worth going out of the way for. They are a cash only business, which used to bother me, but now they've installed an ATM machine at the counter.  Whether you are stopping for lunch or just a shake or ice cream you will enjoy."
China One,Connecticut,East Haven,Daniel C,5,Best Chinese food on main St.  Only thing I dont like is that the fried chicken is made with curry =( maybe they will not put it if I ask next time but its very very clean inside and the crab rangoon is amazing not that pre made frozen stuff the other places serve you

I went there a few years ago and it was excellent, so a bunch of us went there and this time it wasn't such a good experience. The waitress was very, very rude, and after ordering our food, she would come back and tell us they don't have this, and they dont have that, and we had to change our order like 3 times. And when we got the food, it was horrible. I was told there is a better chinese restaurant down the street. Gonna try the other one next time."

You're probably going to pick up something and bring it home and watch reruns of The Office in sweatpants. And for that, no complaints here. The hunan chicken was slightly spicy and surprisingly tender, the rice was perfectly done, the leftovers were even good the next day. Win in my book."

Taste of Asia,Virginia,Roanoke,TARA BROWN,3,A young female hostess didn't greet/speak or talk.  She grabbed menus and gave a look to follow.  It was 20 min or so before we were even acknowledged and our drink orders taken. Once our drinks were delivered the male server said he would be back to take our food order.  He was making drinks at the bar while we waited.  He took our order and went back to making drinks after putting it in.  He brought our food out and it wasn't piping hot so I assume it had been sitting waiting for him to come pick it up.  Usually restaurants have runners/other servers bring customers their food when it is ready and their server is tied up ijs.  The food was delicious regardless.  Large portion sizes that can actually feed two people easily.  My drink was also yummy.  Even though it was New Yrs Eve they were not packed when we arrived so I feel the service could have been way better.  I hope if I go again the service will be different.

Buddakan,New York,New York,Ken C,1,"I need to preface this review with first letting everyone know that I have not actually been to this restaurant. This review is based on an experience my wife had at Buddakan after dining there with a large group and it points out the lack of knowledge of the staff rather than quality of food.
My wife is allergic to mushrooms. She is very good at notifying the servers of this allergy when we go out to dinner, particularly if we are in a ""shared plate"" setting. In this case, she immediately notified the server of her mushroom allergy before being served. They pointed to 2 different types of spring rolls on the menu and told her she could eat one type, but not the other. Another member of the staff came out later on and told her the same thing. They specifically told her it was safe to eat the spring rolls she had in front of her. So she ate them. After she had already eaten one, a third member of the staff came out and said ""Are you the one with the mushroom allergy, because you cannot eat that they are made with mushroom truffle oil"" At this point it was obviously way too late.
My wife wound up paying for a meal that ruined her entire night. She chipped in for her part of the bill and had to go back to her hotel room while everyone else enjoyed a night out for a bachelorette party. On the bright side, ingesting the mushrooms only caused her to projectile vomit all night and she did not have to be rushed to the hospital.
The ignorance of the staff at Buddakan is inexcusable. Not one, but 2 members of the staff assured her that the food was not made with mushrooms. She spent a lot of money on a meal that made her sick and ruined the rest of her night.
She contacted the restaurant and explained the situation. Michele E. got back to her and told her she would call her to discuss the situation. That was on March 28th. Today is April 7th and nobody has called back. They obviously do not care about the fact that they could have killed her. At the very least we would like to have our money refunded to us which is something they should have offered to do immediately. Instead they chose to ignore her. So here I am on Google voicing my concerns.
Think twice about eating here, particularly if you have a food allergy because the staff has no idea what ingredients go into their food. It makes me wonder how many vegetarians have unknowingly ingested meat in this establishment after being told the food did not have meat in it. They could very easily kill someone with a peanut allergy as well. The outcome of this situation could have been a lot worse, and very well can be for someone else in the future who is not so lucky. Complete and total FAIL."

Bo Bo Kitchen,New York,Roslyn Heights,Orit Golos,1,"We are here once before, like two years ago, it wasn't that great then but yesterday it was really tasteless. The hot and sour soup didn't have much in it and had no taste the chicken and beef plates had very little meat in them and lots of cheep vegetables.completly tasteless. The place looks very neglected and not clean. The table was dirty when we came in and piles of dirty plates were just laying there. The prices went up but the quality of food and cleanliness went way down."

Oriental Restaurant,Maine,Brunswick,L Richardson,4,"Always busy...that's a good thing!  There can be a wait if you walk in and place an order To Go but it's worth the wait. The building could use an update. 4 stars because the inside needs a bit of a renovation. The staff are friendly. I have only eaten in-house once. I can eat too much here, but the food is so delicious! There isn't much parking unless you feel like a quick walk which can be a good thing after eating a hearty meal of chicken fingers, beef terriyaki, fried rice or pupu platter. All of it is happiness on my plate!"

This location seems to have delivery to. If you're looking for a Chinese traveling or local and check this place out."

It been a couple years that the food start to be cheap and no the same flavor. Sorry no more for me.
Bamboo Restaurant,New York,Schenectady,Stephen Schlanger,3,They recently jacked up their prices sharply for so so Chinese food. It's the closest to my address so I got food their frequently. Going to return to other restaurants that IMO serve up better food for less money. It's one thing to raise prices a little bit but their prices are now ridiculous. They were reasonable not too long ago.

King Garden,Delaware,Wilmington,Morton Fox,2,"This Chinese takeout is in a strip mall on Rt 4 eastbound. I suspect most of us probably won't get off the highway just for Chinese takeout but it is not far from the Newport exit off Route 141. Anyway, it's a typical family-run operation. The kids run around the front of the store and are quite a handful, but service was nevertheless pretty good, considering.

This evening, we ordered the pork egg foo young and the hot & spicy chicken. The fried rice was mediocre, but I thought the egg foo young was rather good. The hot & spicy chicken had a piece of hard, unidentified foreign matter. Still not sure what that was. Packaging left something to be desired. For Chinese takeout, I'd prefer a plastic box to a styrofoam box because the former is more durable and I can reuse it. Worse yet, they used staples to shut the styrofoam box. Those are not so safe when handling food. A stray staple, if it gets into food and is swallowed, can cause some health complications."

The Schezwan was luke warm and bland, even with the red pepper oil they gave us. (which just tasted like oil with no flavor or spice)  The General Tso's was soggy and inedible. When the server finally came back, (Just to give the check) he didn't even question why we had a full plate that was uneaten and didn't want it to go, just took it away. I could name at least 4 Chinese restaurants in South Florida that is MUCH better. Save your time and go somewhere else."

I'm sick and tired of Staten Islanders and their attitudes towards me because I'm Latino."
China King,Georgia,Marietta,Juan Pardo,2,Honestly the food was not very good. I was a little disappointed. It was my first time. I thought it would be better.

Hunan Cafe,Virginia,Fairfax,racquel thurmond,1,"The food was awful. I ordered general tso chicken which is supposed to be spicy and it was not it was sweet and disgusting. I asked to substitute the steamed rice for fried rice and was told it would be an additional $4 charge which is ridiculously high compared to many other places I've eaten from. I also ordered a side of chicken wings and it was chicken wingettes not chicken wings. The ""wings"" were also disgusting and unseasoned not even hot sauce helped it. I will not be eating from here again and I suggest you take your money somewhere better with quality food. And if I could give them zero stars i would."

New China,New York,Bronx,Kyle Johnson,4,"This has been my go-to Chinese food joint at home in Riverdale. We have some fancy sit down places in the area but this hole in the wall is still my absolute favorite.

Even after all these years, they still but boxes of soda cans right in front of the window, have personal items in the store refrigerator, put their specials in permanent market on cardboard, and plaster their window with local ads. It's like a person who just gave up grooming themselves but is still relatively clean. ""I'm your local Chinese food store, deal with it.""

My favorite dishes here are the chicken and Broccoli (all day everyday, nothing like that brown sauce!) and the chicken eggplant with garlic sauce over pork fried rice <-lunch special for maximum value. LOL autocorrect tried to call it project fried rice hahaha

Compared to other establishments in rougher areas of the Bronx and greater NYC, I always felt like New China had it easy - no bulletproof glass or gated entrance to the kitchen. So as such I don't think their cutting any corners when it comes to serving a community that has supported them for probably over 15 years.

Wait a clip...I just realized I've eaten enough chicken and broccoli to put their kids through college! Good gracious..."

China A Restaurant,Florida,Oakland Park,Ariel W.,3,"You wrote a review for China A	12 minutes ago
3.0 star rating 2/11/2017
On a whim my husband and I decided to stop in here one night. We had never been here before and were in the mood to try something new and so we decided to dine in. The restaurant is very small, only two or three tables. That night it was just our table and one other one having dinner. As soon as we entered we were greeted by a very enthusiastic lady who informed us that they have Chinese, Thai, and Japanese food. Indeed. Their menu is extensive. My husband asked what was good and he finally settled on a rice noodles with chicken in a spicy sauce while I went with my old standby cashew chicken.

While we waited I looked around the restaurant. It was eclectic. There were the usual things you expect to see like Lucky Cat but there was also a large wall hanging of Italy and the flag of Ireland behind their Buddha. I can forgive their confusing decor but not the black air vents and ceiling tiles. They needed a serious cleaning. When I see something like that it is a complete turn off.

Our dinners came with wonton soup served in strange little mismatched bowls. Mine had a puppy face on it. It was like something you would use to serve a toddler. The dinner was good. Plenty of tender chicken in a nice brown sauce with crisp vegetables. I had enough for leftovers and hubby must have enjoyed his because he finished his entire dinner. No egg rolls with dinner though, I thought that was weird. I also thought the bill was high for what we got. it was $30 plus for the two of us not including tip and I only drank water. Not terribly high, I've just had similar for less money. Between the higher prices and grime we probably won't be going back but the decor amused us and was definitely a different kind of experience to eat here."

Jasmine Buffet,South Carolina,Columbia,Kimo Jones,3,Had lots worse elsewhere
Empire Szechuan,New York,Staten Island,Thomas Hare,4,"This place is really fantastic. The food is really good when compared to other chinese/thai/Japanese etc restaurants (they have all 3 types but you have to order the sushi from next door (same owners, neighboring locations). The only draw back is its priced at the higher end of Asian takeout. Lunch combo prices are between $11 and $12. The big dumpling noodle soups are really well put together.the broth and goodies are separate and you pour the broth in. The noodles bowl literally weighs 5 pounds. Well worth the $12 price tag.  Definitely recommend. Pictured are the teriyaki bites from the appetizer menu, $9.50 for 10 pieces and the pork dumpling noodle soup with udon noodles. Would order both again. Also ordered triple crown (the beef, chicken, shrimp, veg and brown sauce) from the chefs menu, $20, delicious. Prices on things I ordered weren't my issue. Its the price of the combos and specials. Seems like they've almost doubled in the past 12 13 years. Oh well."

No indoor seating starting this Monday but they will be open with outdoor tables. Check it out. Highly recommended"

Food King,New York,Brooklyn,Rachel D,4,"I've been a loyal customer of theirs for well over 6 years now and I have to say that their quality has not declined in the least over the years. I've gone into the restaurant since my last review where I solely experienced just their delivery service. Their delivery service is still quick and seamless. I've rarely experienced a super late order. My order is always correct and the wait time for delivery is always within a half hour and I live 10 blocks away, sometimes they're already ringing my doorbell 15 minutes after I called! Usually if they're running late, it's because they're slammed with deliveries so I don't fault them at all because it's a very rare occurrence, like maybe 3 times a year and I order from this place at least once every week.

Today I stopped by for the first time since they opened back up post quarantine, and noticed they installed a huge plexiglass at the counter which is great. The interior of this place is a bit dilapidated but nonetheless appeared clean and tidy. Peering behind the counter and into the kitchen, the floors were clean of any debris or garbage. Seemed to me like a well run kitchen. At the counter, they've got a small slot where you place cash on a paper plate, they are not taking card so keep that in mind when stopping by. Wait time in person was approximately 15 minutes from entering to exiting.

Overall, this place remains a great local Chinese food restaurant. Compared to others in the area, their food is less oily and tastes fresher. Highly recommend their fried chicken wings, shrimp fried rice, vegetable lomein, their fries are also good, shrimp with lobster sauce is always piping hot with jumbo sized shrimp. My brother loves their spare ribs and rib tips.

Definitely check them out, and if they've made a mistake with you before, please consider giving them a second chance. I have not ordered anything from here that wasn't Chinese-American cuisine, and honestly, what do you expect if you order from the Mexican side of their menu? I'd pass on that because you're probably going to be disappointed. You should know better than to order Mexican food from a Chinese restaurant, like come on y'all, this isn't rocket science. Would you order a steak from a sushi restaurant? Just because you can doesn't mean you should, so don't order Mexican from a Chinese take out restaurant!

NOTE: They are closed on Mondays! They're open Tuesday through Sunday 11 am to 10 pm. Their delivery hours for those days are from 11am until 9:30 pm!"

Hoshi Sushi,New York,Stony Brook,Ari Sagiv,4,"High quality sushi. They give you lots of fish and only a little rice in the rolls so you don't have to worry too much about carbs. However, some of the special rolls exceed 10 dollars, when you can just remove 1 ingredient and you get a non-special roll for 4 bucks."

Panda Ichiban Restaurant,New Jersey,Wrightstown,Matt Anton,1,"As a business owner I hate to leave a negative review but this place is disgusting and should be investigated for their food products ""freshness"" or lack of it.

My wife got food poisoning here about a year ago, and recently we went over a family members house that ordered take out. I did'nt think to ask where it was from (Panda), and ate the slop out of respect for the guests.

A few hours later I was violently throwing up and living in the bathroom for the next 20 hours. I then found out I had eaten from Panda and was extremely upset that they got us again. There won't be a third time for me, and make sure there isn't a first for you....go Gold Garden in Columbus; pick up only but you'll save yourself from throwing up every hour from the dirty slop they pass off as food."
Imperial 42,Virginia,Harrisonburg,Bea A,1,"Will never order from them again...i order plain  lomain and  got plain rice and when  i called the guy to complain he was yelling at me saying i got what i order and that it was on the receipt, he was arguing and yelling at me the whole time so i hung up. they sent someone with the plain lomain at my apt my daughter opened the door and the delivery guy came in all the way to the table and was blaming the other delivery guy for bringing the wrong food and as he was talking he was spitting all over my food i was so disgusted that i didnt finish my food i had to threw all of it away...."

Asked the waiter to say that the child came over last week is not worth the money, how to count it today, the waiter replied that the child is very long, more than 1 meter in a week, when the customer is an idiot?

May garden(port jefferson station),New York,Port Jefferson Station,Stephanie C.,4,My first time trying this place. I‚Äôm very picky with my Chinese food and I can never find a decent spot! This place was really good! The sesame chicken was very crispy and flavorful. Most places are very bland. The fried chicken was good and not very oily!!! Definitely will go back and try other items.

New Ming Fat,New York,Brooklyn,Bryan Barrett,5,Love their chicken wings! They give a decent amount and chop it up for you without asking. Typical chinese restaurant setup.
Chen's Chinese Restaurant,South Carolina,Columbia,Miranda Smith,3,"Chen's chinese food is basic, better than most. I hit them up once every few months, nothing I would eat on weekly basis. People in the South don't know what good Chinese food is because it's not prepared properly down here. If anyone can tell me where to find some good Chinese I will greatly appreciate ir."

They are nice family people and I hope they are doing well enough to stay on Main St...I'd hate to lose them.  Reasonably priced items. It's for take out but there are tables to eat there. Never had to wait long for our order and the few times something was missing or not right they made it over right. Good business.

Kulu Desserts,New Jersey,Edison,Luna Light715,5,"I recommend anyone who has a sweet tooth and to come and try their desserts. Their pinky rose waffle icecream has a soft and refreshing strawberry taste. It has contains strawberry icecream, mangos, strawberries, and whipped cream on the side.The banana rainbow waffle icecream ( I think that's what it's called) is very sweet and if you love sugar x2 then it's meant for you. The banana rainbow has a vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate syrup, bananas and fruity pebbles. The sesame waffle icecream is all sesame. Icecream is sesame, dragon fruit covered in sesame, even the waffle is baked with sesame. Each of the waffles are very soft and becomes soggy if mixed with the icecream,  but still tastes delicious. I was also glad to find a taro bubble tea drink that tastes similar to a taro slushie. There is also the option of ordering on a large touchscreen device and after ordering you have a buzzer that gives off a loud sound. Prices are a bit high, but worth it. They also serve food which I will try next time I stop by!"

I got the 50% spice level which was just the right amount of spice for me. However, they have a wide variety of spice levels. They also have a huge variety of bubble and milk teas.

I took it inside the lady gave me back a refund and everything (while coughing and not covering her mouth, it's flu season lady!). However, I just want the customers to know that you should be careful. Especially when you know they really dont invest back into your community anyway. Besides giving you free nasty lemonade."

The lunch menu offers main dish plus choice of delicious soup, but no drink/soda!! :(  I would have given 4 star if there was a option for soda can or soup. The lunch is always hot and feels freshly made. For spice lovers must ask extra spicy. The interior sitting area is good but very dirty and old sofa at the entrance need improvement. If you are ordering go to menu I would strongly recommend. This may be one of the best testing Chinese take out joint in the Avalon park area in East Orlando. I will increase the rating by an addition star if they start offering soda can in lunch menu as option to soups."

I wouldn't really recommend it as it comes with a lot of fatty pieces and tendon-y pieces. My friend said that's how it normally comes, which is why he never orders it. He got the 'Salted Fish, Chicken and Eggplant Hot Pot' which looked really good. We also got the steamed shrimp dumpling appetizer and pan fried dumpling appetizer. Both were good.

The bathroom was really clean. Automatic warm water faucet and hand dryer.

We ordered 2 appetizers , we got 1 after a long wait but never got the other I asked about it waitress said it‚Äôs busy then asked if we can get refills on our drinks she ignored me . Then after 20 minutes I asked about the appetizers again she said not ready. She said different departments your food won‚Äôt be ready at the same time seriously? What‚Äôs the purpose of going out to dinner together if we don‚Äôt eat together? Later they told another table no more rice , well we ordered rice too so guess no rice for us either.  Cancelled my order and we left although they came over to give us a gift card but honestly would never go back. Instead of the gift card try listening to your customers and don‚Äôt ignore them . The waitress was clueless couldn‚Äôt answer anything and just ignored us, busy or not at least  refill the drinks .

Hunan City Restaurant,Maryland,Silver Spring,Nike Alade,1,"The food was gross. I didn't think it was possible to go wrong with Chinese food, but I was wrong. I ordered the general tso's chicken platter and meat dumplings. The egg roll was the first thing I ate and it was subpar. I found myself needing to drown the egg roll with duck sauce to eat it, because it just really lacked flavor. That should've been a clue that the rest of the meal wouldn't taste good, as it's really hard to mess up an egg roll. Next I ate a dumpling and when I bit into it, it was basically a meatball inside the dough. I didn't like the taste at all. I only ate one and will most likely end up throwing away the rest of the dumplings. Then I tried the general tso's chicken and pork fried rice. The rice was ok, nothing too memorable about it. The general tso's chicken was way below my expectations. It seemed like it was lacking flavor, like the sauce had been watered down or something. Overall I was disappointed in the food and felt like flavor was lacking. I wouldn't order from here again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know"
Dynasty Restaurant,Massachusetts,Hopkinton,Fernando Madrona,3,"Good food. 2019
Updated review, we're in a middle of a Pandemic.  My wife and I cook at home almost everyday, i i worked in a restaurant for my first 10 years as an employee.  You would figure that to attract customers and keep your takeout orders up you'd focus on quality and provide customers with good food.  Today on a Tuesday I decided to buy from Dynasty Restaurant, some items where good, lomain tasted burnt, rice tasted old, fried dumplings okay at best.  Come one now, if you're in the restaurant business and you don't want to provide a good product please close.  This is not the first time, or second time the food tastes very off.  I'm done."

China Gourmet Takeout,South Carolina,Goose Creek,Jecilop JP,4,"I tried based of reviews. I'll return. Food was very good mostly. Details below.
Me Fun (pancet) was waaaaaayyy too salty like someone forgot they put salt, did it again, then someone salted again for good measure.
Sweet & Sour red sauce for the chicken is the BEST I've ever tasted and, but a ""large"" bowl is NOT a large bowl of sauce.. was a short round bowl and only half full! Not enough for the order as I was told it would be. At least it wasn't watered down like a lot of places started doing.
Sweet & Sour tempura chicken was not mushy or greasy. Tasted great!
Sesame chicken was excellent.
Fried rice has good taste, but it's just rice and the meat - no veggies. Comes with white sauce.
Lady at the counter was very nice and helpful with me as a newbie there.
No lingering bad aftertaste as happens with many.
Meals are one size vs small and large, but I don't know if sizes are different for lunch vs dinner.
They use trays - not boxes.
If I wanted to eat there vs. takeout, it is very nice and welcoming inside with comfortable seating.
As said, I'll return."

Panda Chinese Restaurant,New York,Greenlawn,D S,5,"My husband and I have been coming here at least once a month for nearly 12 years. Not sure why I never left a comment but I'm not a consistent reviewer! As a regular customer, I'm overdue, so here we go! This place is small, in greenlawn plaza strip mall, with a couple tables inside. It's not really a dine in kinda atmosphere but a good place for quick service. They do a lot of pick up and delivery. We order for pick up and the food is generally ready in 20 minutes. Everything is sizzling in big woks and made fresh. I have never seen flies in here like someone else said. In fact, I call BS on that guy's wonton story, period. The place is small and the building is older but everything is clean. They even wear hair nets and hats which is more than I can say for 95% of the restaurants I frequent. The couple is friendly and they are ALWAYS there, hard workers. They will smile and nod at you but not much for chat because there is a substantial language barrier. The wife does the phones/orders and she knows the menu but if you have any special requests it can take a minute to sort out, please be patient, she tries her best. We have never had a mistake in our order, never been over charged, never had a carton leak in the bag and the food is always piping hot and the veggies are fresh. They do a freebie over a certain amount; $25, $40 and $60... things like a quart of wonton soup, 2L of soda, 2 egg rolls or a large entree for $60+. They do combination meals for dinner at about $9, which not a lot of places do and there are a dozen+ options. It's a nice choice if you're not into leftovers or you're ordering for one. All the combinations come with fried rice and an egg roll. My favorites from the menu are the boneless spare ribs, sweet and sticky with some charred crispy edges. My dog will start drooling like crazy when these come out (yes, she gets some!) The Singapore mei fun has a little bit of everything! Julienne veggies, scallions, chicken, slivers of ribs and little shrimp. The noodles are never overcooked and it's really flavorful without being overly spicey. And they stuff the box, close to bursting! The chicken and garlic sauce is a little bit spicier but I have a low tolerance for heat and for me it's just right, don't be detoured by spicey icon on the menu. (See pic) Despite the name there isn't tons of garlic in here, a bit of minced added to the sauce that creates a depth of flavor without tasting too garlicky. There are loads of veggies; broccoli, snow peas, baby corn, water chesnut and green pepper. Finished with a light, sweet brown sauce that isnt overpowering. The sauce coats everything well but isn't excessive either. In fact, nothing is drowning in sauce in any of these dishes, which I prefer so the veggies stay slightly crisp and nothing is soggy. The wonton soup is great, the broth is flavorful and savory-salty and the dumplings are tender but never mushy. They have that little pocket of meat with some minced water chestnuts for a little texture. They always have thin sliced scallions that finish off the broth nicely and they include a little bag of the crunchy wonton strips, but you don't need them. My husband really likes the hot and sour soup. He gets it everytime, even on a 90 degree day in the summer. The egg rolls are fat and crispy and have the very typical filling of shredded cabbage with minced goodies. These are the thicker wraps, not the smooth spring roll wraps. The texture is rough and bubbly and they're always fried till extra crispy. I would say they're better than average and I always eat them but they aren't the best I ever had. The fried rice is a little hit or miss, sometimes it's light on the peas, onion, and diced ribs or it's a little over cooked but other times it's perfect and full of goodies. My mother in law loves this place too and always gets the fried dumplings (with extra sauce because the dipping sauce is delicious) and boneless spare ribs. She swears by them and she's an extremely picky eater. I would encourage anyone in the area to give them a shot for lunch or dinner!"

All of the food was delicious, and the presentation was artistically and thematically perfection. (Some highlights: the shrimp toast, the carrot dumplings that looked like plump little carrots,  and the lamb. Im not usually a big fan of lamb, but the touch if ginger made for the object balance! ) I also enjoyed the signature cocktails;  nothing too overpowering, but instead,  complementary to the entire dining experience."

Deng Ji Yunnan Guoqiao Mixian,New York,Queens,Hsin Yi Wei,3,"The decor of Deny Ji Yun Nan Guo Qiao Mi Xian is brilliant, bright and wide-spaced. There were both indoor & outdoor dining available during the pandemic and the safety procedures were well-planned.

This was our first time trying Guo Qiao Mi Xian and we were so impressed with how it was cooked after serving. We were so excited to take photos but the staff was really unhappy & rude to stop us since they needed to grasp the timing to put all the ingredients into the broth. However, if they explained to us in advance we wouldn‚Äôt be scared and felt offended.

The food was overall okay with beautiful & gourmet plating. We were kind of disappointed with the taste, it wasn‚Äôt as good as how it looked. The ingredients were various but seafood like scallops & shrimp weren‚Äôt very fresh. The broth was flavorful but too salty for us."

New King House,New York,Queens,Lynn Lan,5,"We have a special connection to this restaurant. It is the place our friends chose to celebrate our wedding 5 years ago. Taking our 3 years old son to the Science Museum in Corona, my wife had the wonderful idea to have a late lunch there.
And I must say even after our 10th visit I still always experience the magic of the place like the first time.
It has the atmosphere of all the American movies I used to watch in Paris when I was young about the real traditional Italian restaurants in NYC where all the real deals were made before they were all shooting at each others..
The d√©cor is great the view from the terrace amazing, the staff have been there forever, and most of all they know all people you know (so you see the allusion of the movies is indeed true).
Well I guess the culinary scene in NYC is much smaller than what I thought.
The menu is so easy cozy that you really have a hard time to make your choice (for me something really special). I know one for sure to have spent a long time in Italy, everything is just authentic with the American charm of authentic Italian kitchen.
Our best friend would tell you that the T-bone steak is Peter Luger style only half price (but between us when I saw the piece of meat coming I could not even believe that a single human being could finish it). Personally I enjoyed a grey sole meuniere that indeed taste like the sole I know from Europe, my wife as usual taste the rigatoni Bolognese that were great. Maxime loved the pasta fagioli (he is a specialist for this special soup). Wine list great, affordable and the cocktails were great. So if you want to feel like being a part of a movie and enjoying the food experience at the same time, that is the place to go."
Hong Kong,Florida,Tampa,Molly Barist,4,"I've been ordering from here at least twice a month for the past 2 years.

It's your standard chinese. I order mixed vegetables with fried bean curd in Szechuan sauce. The mixed vegetables could use more variety and the sauce definitely wasn't Szechuan sauce. The food is a bit pricey for the lack of quality. Delivery was fast but there may be some language barriers when you order."

I even pointed to the duck on the menu that was also translated to Chinese.  He couldn't understand so I left. I really wanted the duck too.

Stacking boxes on the ground , not 6 inches off like the health code instructs . Owners are dim . Blocking off parking spots so that business in the same lot have customers parking crazy is a pissing contest . I have zero problem running my car parallel with the street and blocking off the spots anyway . There is a way to do things and then there is a way to Make things difficult for the business that surround you . If you go to the smoke shop next door , or pizza crave or the barber shop . I dont know how you support this business"

Great Wall Kitchen,New York,New Paltz,Stephen Weinman,5,"I'm giving 5 stars to offset all the 1 stars. This restaurant just changed owners in 2015, so all the reviews about the horrific attitude of the previous owners are off the table. The new owners seem much much nicer, and have put in attractive tables and chairs and even upgraded the faded picture menu above the counter. The food is standard US Chinese fare and is pretty average compared with other Chinese restaurants. They seem to have retained the great wanton dipping sauce of the previous owners, which is a big plus."

Wing Lee ll,Maine,Portland,linda,5,"I question the spotty bad reviews.. I ordered delivery with hardly any voice, recovering from a bad cold and the man taking my order was very patient and thoughtful.. My litmus test for trying a Chinese restaurant new to me is, boneless spareribs, fried dumplings, crab ragoons and pork fried rice, my favs.. and i also tried the scallion pancake, never had them before.. The man said it would be 40 mins.. just under 40 mins later my food arrived.. the delivery guy was courteous, my food was all packed neatly and hot.. and its delicious !!! I'm eating the scallion pancake as i type lol.. found out I like them too.. I will definitely order from here every time I'm in town and will try the dinners.. üëç

China Taste,New Jersey,North Bergen,Pedro Santos,3,Regular Chinese joint. Nothing extraordinary.
China Ocean,Virginia,Portsmouth,D. RII,4,"Overall the best 'fast food' Chinese food place in this Portsmouth area. Most dishes are consistently good, a few aren't my cup of tea. Yes, sometimes the staff can be a little rude or mix up your order, obviously they tend to stay busy. Don't expect gourmet cuisine, but for what it is it is usually well worth it."
Lai Wah Chinese Take-Out Restaurant,Georgia,Savannah,Kay Dee,5,Favorite
China One,Georgia,Ellenwood,Whivel Wind,5,"I ordered the General Tso‚Äôs Chicken, along with shrimp rolls and wonton soup... everything was absolutely delicious! From the quality, to the temperature of the food, to the taste! What I love about their rolls is they don‚Äôt have that slimy gooey stuff inside like some Chinese places... nothing but vegetables and nice fried crispy crunch on the outside! Five stars!!"

Hong Kong Chinese Restaurant,South Carolina,Johnston,Callie Peeples,5,Favorite place to eat at
Wild Ginger,New York,Rockville Centre,Shelly Shells,4,"Updated:

Spoke with the manager and the issue was heard and apologized for. I will continue to patronize this establishment. Two stars changed to four.

Original post:
I‚Äôm so disappointed with my recent experience at Wild Ginger. This is a place that I visit for Asian fusion food whenever I‚Äôm in the area and was looking forward to my dinner. Unfortunately, I was met with more than a few issues. Firstly and mainly, I can‚Äôt believe I was charged a dollar for Chile and plum sauce, which I kept trying to ask and clarify with the hostess if it (plum sauce) was already in the bag, she said no (and when I got home I saw it was). It‚Äôs not the dollar I‚Äôm upset about it‚Äôs witnessing her boldly take the dollar and put it in her tip cup! So rude and deceptive. My intention was to tip her $5 but when I saw that happen, I was so turned off and thought why lie about the sauce cost just to put a dollar in your pocket?! This made me wonder how many other people this has been or it gets done to. Then, I get home and the ribs I ordered have to be days old because they were extra dark, dry and tough (see pics)."
Sun Fung,New York,Bronx,Maria Fuentes,2,Terrible over the phone customer service. Lady had the nastiest attitude.

Number 1 Chinese Restaurant,New York,Middletown,The Adams family,5,Great food
Dragon Palace,New Jersey,Edison,John Nanavati,5,"Absolutely excellent! Very convenient if you‚Äôre coming home from the metropark train station.

I‚Äôve been pining for a good restaurant that I don‚Äôt have to travel to flushing to get to. There are a couple good ones in the area but they‚Äôre few and far between. This is absolutely one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area, but don‚Äôt start going there because I‚Äôll never get in.

We had a fish curry dish and a pork belly. Both were fantastic and we wished we had more

I like to talk to the owners and they were very friendly and personable.

This is one of my new Favorites places."

Old Place Asian Kitchen,Virginia,Front Royal,Neal Jacob,4,They have new owners. We liked the restaurant. It was brighter inside. The old restaurant was always too dark.
Yi Feng Yuan,New York,Flushing,Jeannie Tai,5,"A very well established Shanghai restaurant. Given its in the busy Flushing neighborhood, competition is plenty but this one stands out with the locals. Prices are very reasonable and the food never disappoints.  They even have a deal, order $15+ worth of food (dine in only) and you get an order of soup dumplings (pork filling) for free. Should you want to substitute it for the crab, you may but there's an upcharge of $1 so not free but darn close! The best dishes here besides the soup dumplings, try the spicy fish fillets in the red sauce served in a heated wok, noodles with Scallion sauce (just trust me, it's so good), and the cumin Lamb is excellent."

The chicken soup was very flavorful, with many pieces of very tender chicken. Zjm noodle is a little on the sweet side, they do give you a lot of meat sauce.

Genghis Grill,Florida,Brandon,April McDonald Green,4,"I love the food here. I had a hard time getting a pickup order earlier this week, but they did a pretty good job handling the situation. We got to the restaurant to get our curbside order. I called & they said they were going to bring it out. 15 minutes later, I had to call again & after a few minutes on hold,  they told me my order had been given to a door dasher & they were starting another order that would be ready in 10 minutes. 20 minutes later, I called to check on my order again. They said it was on its way out right then. 8 minutes later, I was calling again to cancel my order (45 minutes was a bit long to have to wait) & they came out the door with our food. I know things happen & I don't blame them for that. I just wish I'd known from the get go that the order was missing. I'd already been waiting almost 20 minutes before they re-started my order. But everyone I spoke with was professional & helpful & the food was good & exactly what we ordered. I don't think I'll order curbside or to go anymore. But maybe when we're up for a night out, we'll stop in."
China Empress,Maine,Winthrop,Linda Yeaton,5,"We go here whenever we want Chinese.  They know me on a first name basis & the last time I called, she even asked if I'd like something that I typically order!!  Impressive!!  And, we like the food!  Been going there for years!!"

Hunan Kitchen,Maryland,Bethesda,Kepler Mears,2,"The only redeeming thing about this place is the speed and service.  The food is nasty as they don't even hide the bottled sauces they use, everything is practically covered in ketchup.  More than anything this place is grossly overpriced for what it is.  13$ for a dish in a greasy spoon Chinese place is ridiculous."

Kowloon Caf√©,New York,Brooklyn,Quan Huang,4,"(Translated by Google) The decoration seems to be different from a Chinese cafe in the 90s, with soft lighting and a clean and hygienic look.
I want a satay beef sandwich, a crispy chocolate condensed milk, and a glass of lychee ice.
The satay beef sandwich feels that the bread is dry and hard in the mouth. The satay beef is marinated and heated well and seasoned well.
The thin taste of chocolate condensed milk is sweet and sweet condensed milk becomes the protagonist, followed by the delicate and sweet chocolate flavor, and then the taste of pancakes, but the pancakes are not crisp.
Lychee ice is a sweet ice water with lychee and ice cubes. Perhaps it was fashionable in the 90s.
There are various types of food here, no chef recommends, and no real specialties can be tasted.

Teriyaki House,Massachusetts,Boston,Calvin W,5,"after accidentally ordering the same thing twice back in undergrad, i now come to Teriyaki House exclusively for their Black Pepper Beef Bowl. and after 8-odd years of semi/annual visits, i can, attest that, with nigh pure certainty, it‚Äôs pretty good.

it used to come on a plate, then they started to serve it in a bowl. and in these covid times it‚Äôs exclusively in a takeout bowl. but one thing remains constant, besides the vehicle it is served in: it‚Äôs pretty good.

enough for a-meal-and-snack-later or one big meal. pretty good."

I stood there and after a few minutes of no one coming to the window yet watching them all work I just left. Finally someone  leaned out the window and addressed me. Ran up my food with the wrong price. I told them that the price on their site was 9.99 instead of $12 and she just said ""thanks for letting me know"" and asked for the $12.75 anyways. I ordered chicken with cashews and I hate to say it....probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Usually Chinese places are pretty cut and dry. This tasted like if you asked me to make Chinese food for you. Tasteless and boring. Nothing special."

Panda Express,Virginia,Portsmouth,Ann Cabell,2,"Panda Express is NOT authentic Chinese good. It's the Americanized version.  I know a lot of people don't know the difference. We went there for dinner tonight,  and I could already see that MOST of the foods were dry, and doesn't look appetizing.  I requested for fresh food even it meant it would take longer.  I ordered 3 dinners.  The first 2 were delivered to our table. The 3rd order was taking a lot longer that my grandson started picking on my food. The 3rd order finally came,  but 1 item missing.  We asked twice before it arrived our table. Their chowmein was DRY. The cashier suggested a bottled drink that cost almost $3.00. The staff looked overwhelmed, robotic, and confused.
It was our last stop for dinner  because most were closed due to hurricane. I don't think we'll be back anytime soon !"

We also had to wait for our receipt which took another 10 minutes. Server was friendly but...not worth the wait if you're looking fpr something fast for lunch.

Wok & Pho Restaurant,Virginia,Dale City,Kristen King,5,"My husband and I ordered here last weekend and we were pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality. I ordered the Singapore rice noodles and teriyaki shrimp. The noodles were great and had chicken, pork and shrimp, slightly spicy but not over powering. The teriyaki shrimp was amazing in flavor! It had 10 jumbo shrimp in a brown glaze sauce. I poured the extra sauce on my rice it was that good. My only complaint is they put leaves of iceberg lettuce in a hot sauce, i guess for a filler. However when lettuce gets heated up it wilts and gets soggy. So that was inedible and went in the trash immediately. They should do carrot slices or a few chunks of broccoli instead. It is something I'll order again though.
My husband got walnut shrimp and the pork pho. The pho was delicious and was a large portion for the price. The stock makes for a good pho and its nice and light. The walnut shrimp got tore up in minutes from my 3 kids who had pizza just minutes before. My 15 month old even ate a whole shrimp! They're jumbo shrimp with a light crispy batter then fried and tossed with a white cream sauce. Just enough sauce to add flavor but not take away the crunchy batter. Then its topped with fresh chopped walnuts. The cream sauce is really nice and surprisingly light. It seemed to be a mayo/tartar sauce that was ever so slightly sweetened. We will definitely order here again. I'm beginning to like this place over Sampan."

China Taste,Maine,Yarmouth,Gina Townsend,2,"I am a huge fan of China Taste. When my hubby and I lived in Portland, we would order from the one on Washington Ave. The food was always good and it was my favorite Chinese place to go.

The food at China Taste in Yarmouth was great too. They loaded the wonton soup with wontons, which was awesome. Everything was just as good as the one in Portland; however, my hubby and I were sadly disappointed a few hours later. We both had pain in our stomachs and felt very ill afterwards. I don't know if the food was cooked differently or what happened, but it didn't sit well for either one of us.

Such a bummer. The next time we're in Portland, we'll probably end up ordering from that China Taste instead."

Looking at other tables seemed to have dishes that all looked delicious that I would love to try soon. I would have given it 5 stars but it took forever to get our check and it drove me crazy watching people come after us and leave before us.

Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet,Maryland,Baltimore,Camila Fern√°ndez,1,"Is sad to see how COVID 19 really has affected a lot of business. But the rating I‚Äôm giving this place is based on the food and the staff. There is no variety of food, and the little food they have is not good at all. Not to mention that even though there was literally less than 7 people in the buffet, the staff decided to sit down instead of paying attention to the customers. Due to COVID this buffet serves the food to everyone like others buffets, i had to wait for more than 7 minutes for someone to serve me my food, when there was a man sitting there that saw me but decided not to help me. Their attitude towards at least trying to please the little customer they have is non existent. Sad to see that maybe this business won‚Äôt last a couple more months but the staff makes it worse. If you do decide to dine here I would suggest you quickly see the food they have so you won‚Äôt be disappointed like we were."
China Wonder,Massachusetts,Fitchburg,Edward Sargent Jr,5,"Great food, other than 1 bad experience with spare ribs. very friendly, quick service, and plenty of options, the staff and owners are great people. Reasonably priced too!"

Capital Buffet,New York,Albany,kattia Villegas,1,"dirty carpet, Restroom. Grilled chicken was cold and taste like the fresh chicken was for long in the refrigerator before cooking. Hot tea had too hot temperature,  it burned my mouth. I said to the cashier that I didn't like the food and she didn't ask why.  At least she said am sorry. I paid $16 for a small portion of cold chicken and some veggies. My appetite went away. Won't come back"

Far East Restaurant,Florida,Bradenton,Larry Larson,1,"Desperate for decent Chinese in this area, I tried Far East for dinner tonight while my wife is away for the week. The obligatory overhead picture menu, a huge completely empty fish tank, a 10 gallon tank overcrowded with goldfish/carp in dirty water, three sticky tables -- OK, two sticky tables, with the cashier/order-taker's laptop taking up the third. No ice or glasses available for drinks, fried rice a $2 substitute for steamed with a dinner.

I ordered a small wonton soup, orange chicken, and a large chicken fried rice. Everything came at once, about three minutes after I sat down. The soup was the usual canned wonton soup, decently flavored, but one of the wontons contained a piece of meat that was not recognizable as normal western chicken -- possibly from the neck, or gizzard. The orange chicken, served with three raw broccoli florets, was old and tired, and encased in rock-hard fried batter, with an orange sauce so sweet that it hurt to put it in your mouth. The huge portion of chicken fried rice had a decent number of nicer-looking small bite-sized cubes of chicken, but overall was as dark as beef gravy, and not particularly tasty.

The woman behind the counter was nice, but the food was terrible. I would never go there again, take my wife there, or order their take-out or delivery. You can have ten times better food for half the money at Chipotle."

The East Asian Cuisine,Massachusetts,Great Barrington,Christopher Tatro,5,"By far this is my favorite Chinese restaurant oin the town of Great Barrington. Wide open space and plenty of seating. Can get crowded but overall never too bad. Parking is never an issue. And the selection of food, drink, and sushi is awesome. Tom Yum soup is normally my go-to appetizer and pork moo shu is the main course. The plum sauce is delicious.

The other dish I highly recommend is the Singapore  Mei Fun. Can be a little on the spice side but the portions are out of this world and you can't beat the taste."
Panda Cafe,Virginia,Fairfax,Mike Hershkovitz,4,Good food. I wish the Lo Mein was better.
Dragon Wok Chinese Restaurant,North Carolina,High Point,Joel Johnson,3,"Dragon Wok offers a lunch buffet at a reasonable price.  It's not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it's not horrible, either.  Drink refills require you wait at the counter for someone to fill the drink for you."

Dynasty,New York,Queens,Vivian Fiscaletti,4,"Kind people realty good food, COVID  conscious."
China Kitchen,New Jersey,Wayne,Dean,2,"This Chinese restaurant has gone down in quality and service over the years. It used to be pretty decent, but my most recent visit will be my last. I dined in and it was like they don't even care about you as a customer. The TV was on a children's show extremely loud, and the workers kids were sitting next to me watching it. Akward, but if it couldn't get worse next thing I know the whole family was having a meal served very different from what I was given (nice bowls and silverware). I found this very rude.
It's disappointing because the setting would be nice if they'd keep up with it. The table was sticky and gross. 2 stars because food wasn't terrible. I don't recommend though."

Feng Ye,Massachusetts,Westfield,Johnny Forgey,4,Food is great. Staff is extremely friendly. Building is very old. The inside can use some work if they want to bring in guests to dine in.

China Gourmet Takeout,South Carolina,Goose Creek,Stephanie Pilger,1,"Dear China Gourmet.... I just spent the last 30 MINUTES sitting in your restaurant waiting for my food that was sitting in the counter waiting on me! I placed an online order on my way home after working a 13 hour shift to get there and have to wait because of your incompetent girl working the counter. I told her that I had placed an online order and told her my name and she told me it would be ready shortly. It wasn't until after another customer's food came up that ordered after me dod she check the bags for mine. By the way, my food was cold when I got home, so thanks for that as well! Never again will me, my friends or family eat at your establishment. You are officially blacklisted!!!"

Lam's Garden,North Carolina,Greenville,2018 Newly,3,"I won't be ordering from this restaurant again because delivered foods was not as tasty as I thought it would be. I order steamed dumplings because China King steamed dumpling are so delicious, so I thought I would try steamed dumplings from another restaurant to see if theirs good as China King. My answer is no because Lam's steamed dumpling were too doughy and big while China King steamed dumplings are thin and delightful every bits. I will keep ordering from China King until a chinese restaurant can beat them. Lam's Garden your foods was okay because I did order the healthy chicken with veggies. That was very delicious to me but still it is not worth or enough for me to order from you again. Check the pictures out of my doughy steamed dumplings and check out the pictures from China King steamed dumplings, a complete difference. There was white with the steamed chicken and veggies which was tasty eating along with the chicken and veggies. Also there's sauce with the chicken and veggies as well which has no taste at all. I still used it on the chicken and veggie dinner. Here's a complete order that I order from Lam's Garden"

Four Four South Village,New York,Queens,Sophia Calderone,4,"Comforting soups with great chewy noodles and a soup base that reads like a clean tasting younger sibling of a richer broth. Maybe a dollar or two higher than it could be but in Manhattan it'd be priced aight and no one would bat an eye. Satisfying portion. Lacks the pretentiousness of manhattan. Great for giving yourself a space to feel safe with some soup.

If you like cozy unassuming places. Low-key comfort food. And feel like a weary traveller. I think you'll find a sense of safety and comfort in eating here. I definitely can see myself coming back here if I was in the area to try some of their other dishes."

New Double Happiness,New York,Brooklyn,Liv Dillon,5,"This place has the tastiest dim sum we have had in South Brooklyn and we have been to maybe 8 different well regarded places.  It seems to have low reviews from folks who walk in looking for American Chinese food (you are not going to find that here).

We went for Dim Sum (breakfast/brunch).  The food was super fresh and though the place is small new varieties kept coming out.  We had a fried spring roll in rice roll that might be the best single dim sum dish I‚Äôve ever had.  The chicken feet (not the orange ones) were the best I‚Äôve had anywhere.

Here is what you need to prepare yourself for if you don‚Äôt speak Chinese. 1. They don‚Äôt speak English (get over it and just point as they wheel by food for morning/early afternoon dim sum) most dishes are $4 or $5 with the ‚Äúspecials‚Äù being $7.  2. You are going to have to sit with some people who don‚Äôt speak English unless you come with a part of 8. 3. It‚Äôs a bit dingy inside, but the food is totally worth it.  Definitely replacing Choi Fook as my go-to local dim sum place."

Chef King Henrietta,New York,Rochester,Derrick Agins,5,"Have never been disappointed when ordering from here. Cheap food that tastes good. It is not authentic but, is definitely above average when it comes to American-Chinese food. Since we are in an area where chinese food is normally a toss up as to whether or not it will be ok or terrible it is nice to have a place that consistently delivers good results.

Food:    (3) - Very good my favorite chinese delivery joint
Decor:   (2) - Standard, nothing special
Service: (3) - Great, they are fast, friendly, and are understanding if they have to wait a bit, I know from personal experience.

Pro tip: If you want a great meal to split between 3 people get the ""5 Stars Around the Moon"". It comes with 5 fantail shrimp (battered and fried), 1 chicken (large chicken breast that has been battered and fried) white rice and a dish that has veggies and just about every meat they offer in a tasty brown sauce. Tons of food for only $14 bucks."

Chef Ho's,Rhode Island,Providence,Higgi Moms,4,"This is my whole family's favorite Chinese restaurant. We can always agree to eat at Chef Ho's! The food is always made with amazingly fresh ingredients and everything we have tried has been delicious. The service is quick and it is rarely overly crowded, we have never encountered a wait time. The atmosphere is pleasant and inviting for the whole family including the toddler. The staff is always very accomodating and make sure to take good care of all of our wants and needs for our meal. The only thing holding me back from a 5 star rating is the lack of handicap accessibility. It seems to be a very common problem in some of the older areas of town but it can be as simple as storing a folding store bought ramp for your handicapped patrons. We are fortunate that our family member is able to step up the 1 step to gain entry into the building however full time wheelchair users will not have the same opportunity.
Overall a great experience with delicious food and friendly staff."

Shanghai Chinese Food and Bar,Georgia,Roswell,Suzanne C,2,"I hope they can get it together because the concept is fun, but the lobster was so not good.  Dry, stringy, not cracked and way overpriced for that.  The wait staff was fine except when I mentioned the poor quality of the lobster, they only offered an vague apology. $57 for one very sub par meal.  They don't know me so they may have thought I was trying to get some free seafood!  With the words ""street food"" in their name, I would have thought the items would be a little better priced.  Oh well... I did like the charging stations at the bar!"

China Wok,Virginia,Clifton Forge,Ms T May Johnson,4,"The food was awesome however I was there during the tail end of this COVID mess and you have no choice but to pass through this tiny 4 by 4 entrance where you are stopped in a very high volume of shared traffic to either pay for or pick up your food if not also order. Everyone otherwise waits outside or in a chair in this 4 by 4 entrance way. And the whole restaurant is entirely blocked off including the bathrooms.
Most sensible places block off their register ordering counter with 6 feet of furniture & use a reaching basket or container to pass money and orders when possible.... This place is designed for no 1 else but managers & employees doing little for you if you are the general populace."

We thew the majority of it away. I wish I could go back in time and not order from here. One dish we ordered was the broccoli lovers dish, which we added shrimp and veggies to, making it $16. The shrimp were miniature shrimp that tasted frozen, and the vegetables were 4 pieces of green beans added to the dish. It tasted only of the frozen shrimp and burnt garlic, nothing else. The pad Thai box was soggy and slimy. The spring rolls were all roll and very little filling. We had 2 orders of them. We ate them because we were starving and our meals were literally not edible. We are now hungry and $50 poorer."

China Wok,Florida,New Port Richey,Kim Wilson,4,"Consistantly Good
This is one of the few places where you can get shrimp toast. The hot and sour soup is always great and my husband loves the egg drop. I don't care for the egg rolls because they are more doughy with not enough filling. The crab Rangoon is perfect and I like the fried rice that you get with the combo meal. The wings are good and the breading has a bit of a sweet flavor. I get the cashew chicken and have them put all white meat and add spice and my husband gets the general tso chicken that has a light breading in a sweet sauce. I usually have them add extra veggies to that dish."

China Station,New Hampshire,Lebanon,Amanda Potter,2,"This used to be my favorite Chinese in the Upper Valley. The Chinese here is nothing compared to MA Chinese, but this place was the closest. Now they're never really open and the quality of the food has gone down hill. I happened to drive by today because they were open! So I ordered the usual for the family. The Crab Rangoon had barely any stuffing, it was all wonton. The GT chicken was mostly all breading with little chicken. Such a disappointment. This was my favorite place! I'm assuming they're trying to make up for food costs and decrease in business time, but this is a great way to drive the regular customer base away. It also seems they're more interested in advertising their kids restaurant in Hanover called Noodle station. I went to try it one day when they were closed and was also not impressed. High prices and the food was not impressive at all... I really have to leave them a bad review when I've been going to the place for so long, but the quality has just gone down so much something had to be said. I probably won't be going anymore and will steer my business to Peking Tokyo, their food is good and they're the only place around that delivers."

Dandelion,Georgia,Cumming,Jonathan Haggas,1,"Owner sat on his butt watching us stand there after walking in for about 5 minutes. Finally, after seating ourselves we got our drinks 20 minutes later which included half cooked tapioca in a boba tea drink. Disgusting... Also mind you there was a family that had arrived about 15 minutes after us and was seated and served their drinks and entire meal before us.

Our orders were straight from the menu with no special requests. After getting tots with no condiments, I had to ask for ketchup and got packets in a bowl. Overall food was like to low-end fast food. Way overpriced for junk food and crappy service. Was never asked for a refill or how things were. For someone who eats out about everyday I think all the other reviews are fake because it was just gross. Understanding a 1 star is low, but it was just that bad.

Think of your high school cafeteria food being 4 stars and then reduce the stars by a factor of 3. Two of my family members couldn't take more than a few bites. Seriously a great place if you do not want to not over eat or if you want to loose a date."

Oriental Garden,Georgia,Monroe,Zach Hughes,4,"The quality of food in this place rivals big city Chinese take out restaurants. The decor of the restaurant is nice, though I can't recommend dining in because the staff seem more interested in their iPhones than service. However, I give this place 4 stars because I only get lunch specials to go. You get the same amount of food as the dinner portions, but for half the price. I recommend the ""house spicy mustard"" for consumption with the egg rolls. The turmeric laden yellow sauce will clear your sinuses with a flavor reminiscent of wasabi. It's easily the best Chinese food in Walton County, for whatever that title is worth..."

There's far too many other Chinese establishments in close proximity to be bothered with the traumatic experience you will have at this place. If it wasn't for the methadone clinic being pretty much attached to the building they wouldn't have a customer base, but as long as addicts want greasy fried food they'll eat the slop served here."

New Wok,Connecticut,Newtown,Nick Blechar,4,"I had a great meal here and would try it again.

Initially, I was put off by a strong, unappetizing smell of dish soap coming from the kitchen. By the time my Scallops With Black Bean Sauce came out, I think I stopped noticing the smell. The scallops were seared beautifully (better than a lot of high end restaurants I've been to). The dish was loaded with fresh asparagus, zicchini, baby corn, mushrooms, water chestnuts, shallots, and red peppers. The sauce was light and tasty -although a tad too much soy sauce.

I was impressed and am looking forward to trying more of their food. There are several other Chinese restaurants in the area, but this is the best one I've tried so far."

So, at $27 per person for an all you can eat meal, it's definitely worth it! Oh, you are capped at a 2 hr time limit. That's pretty understandable.

China Chef Restaurant,New York,Batavia,Christopher Martone (Starcrescendo),2,"Was not good at all. Probably the worst Chinese buffet I've ever been to. Visited on a Friday, there was literally no selection. The pork fried rice fresh from the kitchen had 2 tiny pieces of pork in it. One of the 'soups' was literally just rice in water. Disgusting. No soup noodles to be found, no green onions, and the wonton soup desperately needed some flavor because it was like water. And the staff never came by to clear tables or refill drinks. Desserts had clearly been sitting all day, Jello was solidified and stuck to the bottom of the pan. Buses came through like crazy, those people will eat anything I guess because they seemed to like it here. Will not be back. However, front desk staff was very nice, friendly, and welcoming."

The stars were the egg rolls and Sesame chicken(some of the best I've ever had.  Despite being dunked in good sauce, it was still crispy at home.  The steak and egg roll were great....plump crispy and the steak had great flavor.  Pass on the dumplings - long and waxy.  I prefer the plump type with one side very well fried.  If you visit China House, certainly get egg rolls and any fried chicken item - delish"

El Palacio Buffet,Florida,Orlando,mike H,1,"Food is disgusting!!! Do yourself a favor and avoid this establishment. Dirty, food looks like pig slop and not because they had their feet available to eat. Been to many Buffet's and this has to be the worst. They don't know if they want to be a Latin food buffet or Chinese and it looks like it use to be Chinese because the tables have Chinese writing on them. They make you pay before eating and found out fast the reason why. AVOID THIS BUFFET!!!."

Lin Garden 2,Florida,Poinciana,Millie V,5,Love the food real Cantonese NYC style flavor  never had a problem with the people who answer the phone they always take my order right and that's what matters. Kudos to them because they work under a lot of stress a lot of people purchase there and they still manage to give you what you ask for . People that are more concerned about the lady on the phone or whatever I just have this question what's more important that or your food is not poisoned and it's actually good and after you ate the food did you die? Start learning how to cook at home instead of ordering out and then complaining about it when somebody else took your order right and  made your food bunch of ungrateful obtuse people.

Chow Town Grill & Buffet,Georgia,Valdosta,Willie Nelson,5,I was very surprised by the selection here.
Plump Dumpling,New York,New York,Athena Chang,4,"I have to say Plump Dumplings excel in their curry noodle soup and homemade dumplings.

The owner is Malaysian Cantonese and therefore, their curry noodle soup with bbq pork is quite authentic and I love the spice.

The dumplings are huge although the dough is a little too thick in my opinion. It is still pretty good in the area.

The other dishes are alright so I would recommend getting either dumplings or the curry soup.

They are almost always open regardless of weather. So you can always count on them when you are hungry in the storm!"

Ma LaLa Chinese,New York,Astoria,Faith A Bianchi,3,"I like the idea of this place, but was disappointed in the food quality. I thought putting broccoli and other vegetables in beef noodles was not authentic and a little lazy. A Chinese vegetable like bok choy would be more appropriate. The broth was a strange color red and not full of flavor as beef noodle broth should be. The dumpling wheel looked nice but the skin was tough and the filling underwhelming. I'm happy to see a place like this in my neighborhood, but I was a shocked at the steep dinner prices and don't think the value matched the price. Maybe I'll come back for lunch when I need a noodle fix."
Fortune Wok,New York,Clifton Park,Darwin Hernandez,5,I've been buying from here for more than 10 yrs. The closest thing to NYC Chinese food.
Golden Pot,North Carolina,Jacksonville,Tye Food,3,"Had lunch with my wife here. Food was fresh, wonton soup was very delicious, Fried Rice wasn't anything to write home about though. My Wife ordered the Orange Peel Chicken and very Pleased with it. I ordered the General TSO Chicken and it was the best I have had in the Jacksonville, NC area. The pork egg roll had a fishy taste to it that was very off-putting, and the Dr. Pepper fountain soda lacked flavor. All in all as long as you avoid the Fried rice and the egg rolls you will have a 5 star meal."
Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet,Maryland,Baltimore,Professor Huang,2,"It was a Ok experience, but there were marshmellos in the sweet potaos. I got 3 dirty plates. Their rainbow icecream thing tasted like soda with milk. After it melted it started to fizz. The food was also Ok but there was a lot of errors I guess. Definitely isn't my favorite place but if you're looking for a place to eat you could come here, but definitely not for like a special family thing, or something."

Dragon City Chinese Restaurant,Virginia,Portsmouth,Janice,4,I have tried all the Chinese restaurants in my area and prefer their food to the others. You can watch them prepare all the food which I find reassuring. This is the only Chinese restaurant I have patronized for the last 2 years. I don't go anywhere else. The prices are comparable to all the other similar restaurants. They offer delivery which is a plus. I didn't give 5 stars because I feel like the cleanliness of the eating area could be stepped up a bit. Otherwise great food!
El Palacio Buffet,Florida,Orlando,Momo Senza»õii,4,"The restaurant is pretty good. I came here with some friends to check it out. There is a nice variety of Carribean-Latino and Asian foods on the buffet. Everything was hot and fresh and the quality of the Latino foods were up to par. The staff was nice at the front desk but the servers seemed stressed and tired when they attended to us. Made us feel bad to even request a refill on a drink.

Other than that the restaurant is pretty good and I'd say to swing by and try it out. There is something for everyone on the buffet."

Very nice lady walked me through the menu. Incredible Szechuan flavors that she argued might be too authentic for the American crowds. I told her to keep it exactly the way it was and the customers will come. I highly recommend the beef noodles!

She walked me through the menu and helped me order what I wanted. Be careful with the heat because they do not play any games! You can always add more heat after if you don‚Äôt find it spicy enough."

Wong,New York,Brooklyn,Amy Ng,4,"I may have just found my new spot for hand pulled noodles on 8th ave! I know of this place, was always skeptical about it for some reason until yesterday.

Didn't know what to get, so I got the House Special Hand Pulled Noodles. Hey, can't go wrong if a little of everything came in it, especially on first visit, get to taste a bit of everything for future reference. Delicious toppings included tripe, beef stew, pork chop, vegetables, and fried egg in the bowl. The thickness of the noodle strands were pulled consistently, and stretched to about an arm span's length.

Scallion Pancake (thought I could use a small snack). The guy asked with or without egg. Never heard of scallion pancakes with egg before so I stayed on the safe side and went without. Best pancakes I've had in a long time! Lightly crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside (I'm definitely coming back for the egg). The smell of it was incredible, something simple done just right.

For the portions of the food, the prices can't be beat. NO tips required! Don't forget to try their sauces lined up by the counter!"

Gourmet Spring,New York,Flushing,Eric Qiu (Magic Q),5,"We passed by yesterday. Not feeling the mood of eating crab naked next door, then come into the restaurant. Firstly we didn‚Äôt expect the dishes would be that delicious because the rating for the restaurant is just over three stars. We are fully surprised after the the dishes come and that was amazing! It brought me the feeling of go back my hometown. I was born in Shanghai and the taste is the most authentic Shanghainese one I‚Äôve ever tried in NYC no matter in China town or Flushing. There are few guests inside. We were so glad that we made the choice to this restaurant. Highly recommend the crab. PS. It‚Äôs not a fast food cheap restaurant, but I do feel the cuisines worth every penny I spent. We‚Äôll definitely come back again."

P.F. Chang's,North Carolina,Durham,Brad Tanner,3,"I review based on food not ambiance. But if ambiance is what you are looking for then this is the best you'll find for Chinese food. Comfortabl decor and music and not too loud. I came here for lunch and the problem with PF Changs is one of cost. The Korean BBQ chicken was indeed wonderful but far too minimal to be enough food. And given the charge of an extra few bucks for soup (which too was minimal, but tasty) that means over $11.50 for lunch. I got some veggy sides hoping that that would be more interesting. I'd say the green beans were indeed very pleasant and a true winner. With a large plate at $5.25 that's your best deal. The cucumber was ok, not special. And the spinach was trying to taste interesting but not very appealing (but abundant). Finally remember this is a chain, don't expect spicy, even when it says spicy. The food will be perfect for the typical NC audience that prefers non-spice."

I would recommend to visit somewhere else for a quick bite, this is a decent Chinese takeout restaurant."
P.F. Chang's,Virginia,Newport News,Carol Spencer,3,"The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is nice.  Clean. The food, not so much. The egg drop soup was not good to me - it did not taste like any egg drop soup I have ever eaten before, just tasted like broth. The pad thai was literally covered in carrots. I had to move at least two servings of carrots to the side of the dish to even see the pad thai, and was disappointed with the flavor. I did not finish my meal and declined to take any of it home with me. The peach tea was good. So were the lettuce wraps. I don't think I will be returning to this restaurant to eat."

Buddakan,New York,New York,Hanna Mo,2,"I really wanted to like Buddakkan, but it just didn‚Äôt do it for me. My friend from out of town was visiting so our party of 3 decided to try the Tasting Menu III. We paid for a 4th person per their policy which is understandable and honestly reasonably priced given how much food comes out, but I will have to say, the food was not great.

We were all super excited because we‚Äôve never really tried fine dining experience at a primarily Asian cuisine restaurant, but the food reminded me of takeout, just more expensive. I will also mention, 2 out of the 3 of us didn‚Äôt feel well after our dinner and thought nothing really of it at the time. We then had leftovers for lunch the next day, and again, both of us were not well!

I really wanted to like it here considering the ambiance is amazing and the service was good, but nothing wowed me about the food and I just ended up getting sick. The tasting menu is reasonably priced, but it‚Äôs definitely not a cheap meal. For what we paid, I would‚Äôve expected much more. Glad I gave it a try, but not thrilled about my experience."

China Cafe,New York,Manlius,Jay Morse,1,"I have been going to China Cafe for a very long time and will never go back. I called to place an order 2 combos and Crab Rangoon basic order nothing complicated. I placed my order to the rude woman who usually answers the phone. When I‚Äôm done ordering she just says ok thank you and hangs up with no time estimation. It usually takes 10-20 minutes and we arrive in 15 minutes. We get in and go right to the counter as usual and give my phone number and she says just sit down. I sit for 15 minutes before the lady yells at me across the restaurant ‚Äúcan I help you? What are you doing here?‚Äù So I walk up and say ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm here to pick up my order, you told me to just sit down‚Äù she asks my phone number and I give it to her she walks towards the back and talks to another girl and she says just a few more minutes. I sit back down with my daughter and wife. 15 more minutes go by and I go back up to the counter and she is clearly avoiding me and calls someone else‚Äôs number. The guy walks in front of me and takes his order. Most places would have at least acknowledged me and apologized for the wait. I ask her how much longer and reminded her of my phone number. She walks back and points down and says this is it. I stand at the counter for another couple of minutes while it bagged up. I WAS NEVER EVEN REMOTELY RUDE AT ANY POINT BY THE WAY. I reluctantly pay because my pregnant wife is starving. After I pay she says is this your first time here? I said no I have been coming here for years (10 years actually) she said oh next time tell us when you‚Äôre here. I was astonished at how rude she was not to mention it was my third time at the counter. The food is good here but this experience was so terrible I will never step foot in there again. *#‚Ç¨* this place."

Overall it was good if not great - the noodles were good and chewy, it had good flavor, but I can't think of anywhere else in Astoria which has anything with that kid of flavor profile or quality of noodles.

It's fast casual style with an atmophere that's smart but not super comfy, so probably not somewhere you're going to linger too long.

Prices were a little higher than most similar places in the area, but next time I want a quick bowl of noodles or dumplings, I'll be back to work my way though the menu."

I am not a fan of delivery services and will only order from places that use their in house staff for deliveries which makes choices for food limited these days. This place doesnt deliver but it is very close to home and I thought I would try it and I'm glad I did. Much better than the last place we used to order from and prices and portions are great. Appears that they are under new ownership too..seems clean inside ...food tasted and looked very fresh and it was well worth trying. Will be back for sure. Now all they need is to start delivering but not use a service for that and I will be very happy!!

Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet,Maryland,Baltimore,Lisa Monroe,4,The food is food but some of the waiters not so good.
Ming Wok,New York,Jackson Heights,Lynn Lan,4,"Warning: their spring rolls will spoil you for life and ruin your relationship with eggrolls!

I used to tolerate eggrolls even though I was never too fond of them, but once I discovered Ming Wok's spring rolls I have refused to touch another eggroll. Haha. They take me back to my childhood trips for dim sum with my HK born grammy with every bite. They are so, so much tastier than eggrolls and more authentic, too. I still haven't found another takeout place nearby with spring rolls on the menu. Even if I did, I doubt they'd be better than Ming Wok's anyway!

Quality and authenticity here are a step above most takeout joints. It's still takeout, but it's darn tasty and more freshly prepped than elsewhere. I share Dennis K.'s love of the Singapore mai fun. Great dish packed with goodies. It's an amazing value. The eggplant with shrimp is also really yummy.

Delivery is quite fast - usually within a half hour (and I live a fair distance from them). The interior of the restaurant itself is very clean and well maintained. (It's actually much more pleasant than many of the grungy sit-down restaurants in Flushing. Heehee)"

The two Chinese restaurants just a block away in either direction give you enough food for a man. This place gives you barely enough for a small child.

Golden Million,Connecticut,Norwalk,Joe V,1,"This restaurant has fallen off drastically in recent years.  The food is carelessly made, and the woman at the front desk is disgracefully rude and none of the employee care about service or making good food.  If you are lucky enough for any of them to look up from their cell phones you'll wish you had gone to another restaurant for your food.  I'd  recommend looking into any of the multitude of restaurants similar to this in the area.  China King is a great substitute for this horrendous restaurant."

Peking Chef Restaurant,Virginia,Fairfax Station,Justin Markey,5,"I go to this place a lot. I enjoy New York style Chinese food and there are only two places in this area I will go to for that. I think the Google rating is a little low and majority of negative ratings were years ago, so I‚Äôm giving five stars to boost their rating closer to a 4.

I think it depends on what you order here too. Their serving sizes are quite large and can easily be two meals, making great leftovers. My favorite things here are beef and broccoli, Singapore rice noodles, egg roles, and Kung pao chicken. I did not care for the orange chicken because the breading around the chicken was soft.

The owner is also not rude. He‚Äôs got a kitchen to run and orders to take at the same time, so he is just busy. Good local business!"

Genghis Grill,Florida,Brandon,Dee Roberts,5,"My family and I have never had a bad experience here.

Everyone loves making their own bowl and choosing their own sauce. The service is fast and friendly and the meat and vegetable choices are plentiful .

There is an art to layering your chicken, shrimp, pork, beef and veggies. The more you go the better you'll get at making your own bowl and maximising your dinner dollars.

Be sure you remember to add spices along the way."

Golden Run Restaurant,South Carolina,Bennettsville,Jannette Holiday,4,Food not hot enough
New Taste of China,New Jersey,Clifton,Karen McQueen,1,"Had the worst customer service at this place. We ordered over $50 worth of food through their online ordering. Part of our order was a pint of vegetable lo mein and we ordered a chicken and broccoli combination. The online drop down menu for the combination had rice options, but in the special instructions we asked for the rice to be subbed out with vegetable lo mein instead. A few minutes after submitting the order, we got a phone call from the restaurant. A girl stated that they were out of vegetable lo mein for the combo platter. I asked if what that meant regarding the pint we had ordered. She said she didn't know, her manager just told her to call and say they were out of it for the combination platter. I said ""are you out of stock or is it just not an option for the combination?"" she said she needed to check and put me on hold. I sat on hold for over 10 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back, to which the line picked up but no one said anything and I sat there saying hello while I heard them talking in the background for over 5 minutes. I hung up again and called back and at that point they just picked up and hung up. I got in my car to drive over to see what was going on with my order. Again, it was $50 worth of food. When I got there, a man came out, I'm guessing who was the manager and asked me what I needed. I said you guys called me and said there was an issue with my order but never spoke to me regarding a resolution. He basically said, you can't choose lo mein for the combination, you have to choose rice.  Ok! I totally get that. But why couldn't I be told that instead of being lied to by being told you were out of stock? He just said he couldn't talk to me earlier because he was cooking then I kept bothering them by calling back. Then told me since I had a problem they aren't fulfilling my order and they are just refunding me. Fine by me. I will never be going there again."

Golden House Restaurant,Maryland,Bethesda,Ben Gunnell,5,"Golden House is an excellent Chinese delivery service and take-out restaurant.  It is also great for lunch as their menu includes egg rolls, unlike the Bethesda competition for a lower price.  In their delivery, they always arrive very quickly and the food is consistent.  They also always bring napkins. :)

There is always plenty of parking right off of Rockville Pike.  I like the house look of the restaurant, but it is too bad there is no dining area.  A table or so would work pretty well in there.  The restaurant is actually green, but I suppose calling it, ""Green House"" just wouldn't have that special ring to it.  It gives the customer a feel of get-in, get-out.

I think the cashiers could be a little more engaging, but I think that's industry standard for Chinese restaurants to prioritize an effective product and timely service.  In so doing, they more often seem to minimize the customer interaction.  I always feel rushed, for example, when ordering.  This is different, for instance, than a Thai restaurant, so perhaps it is cultural rather than just being a language barrier."

Jasmine Cuisine,Massachusetts,Quincy,J,4,"One thing about this place that I can say with absolute certainty is that you'll one hundred percent get what you pay for as far as portioning goes.

Every time I've ordered from this place, which haven't been too many, still, the amount received for the price paid is just astounding. Far exceeds many other chinese food locations in that regard.

As far as individual taste and pallete goes, that's a bit more complex to convey, but it seems they use very light, natural ingredients and don't go too hard on the frying/cooking oil.

I would personally recommend they try experimenting with some different recipes, stronger flavors and unique dishes individual to their style, but as it is it's no less than any other spot for taste. Just preferential at that point."

Every meal I've had at any Panda Express has been consistently excellent for the last 13 years. If you don't like Panda Express, you're wrong and I'll eat your share of food to keep them in business.

I've eaten at this location twice already and the staff is great. Food is fresh, hot, and tastes just like it did when I first tried it all those years ago. Panda has the assembly line process perfected which gets you in and out quickly. Keep up the good work you Pandamaniacs. Thank you for coming to my town and thank you for your service."

Plates could easily be split here or one order could serve as at least two meals if you enjoy leftovers. (When re-heating rice in microwave add a little water sprinkled on it and it will have a more fresh texture- but stovetop reheating produces better results, but still add a touch of water to enhance the texture of the rice)."

My friend picked the spot, since they were from out of town. Glad they got a reservation. On a Sunday night we were looking at 45min-1hr for a table. They offered bar seating but at this kind of place you didn't want to be at the bar. Its nice and we wanted to enjoy our meal in a comfortable seating area. The noise level is pretty loud, but manageable just don't sit at the end or you won't be able hear everyone at the table. Waiters were very polite and accommodating. They suggested good choices for us.

We got the short rib dumplings, short rib scallion pancake, lobster egg rolls, wild mushroom chowfun, grilled whole seabass.

I have to say this was a fancy spot, and pricey, we did 4 dishes amount 4 people which was just right with some wine. Came out to 50 a head roughly before tip.
I have to say the flavoring of food was satisfying. Some of the dishes I felt I knew how they would taste surprised me. It was packed with different fragrances and flavors. The sea bass I felt like I could still taste the Smoked Apple grill on my tongue still.

We didn't stop and also got dessert!

Dessert as Coconut Mousse
mango creme, thai basil, puffed rice
Maple Bread Pudding
maple creme caramel, peanut ice cream
Chocolate Pistachio Cremos
cherries, cocoa nibs, pistachio ice cream

Everything was really on point, I wish I had more room to eat it all, but had to spot eating after reaching beyond full. Worth a try, the decor is beautiful, maybe a little confusing to navigate once downstairs and trying to find the bathrooms. Don't expect it to be quiet, but enjoy a good time. The time at the restaurant was a bit slower paced, but enjoyable with good company and conversation.

Qing Feng Chinese Restaurant,New Jersey,Linden,Tina Treich,1,"Absolutely HORRIBLE! This used to be a great place to go but our last few trips were awful. Dry and cold food, missing signs telling you what was being served so if you have a food allergy you won't know. And speaking of food allergies they don't keep food that contain high allergen items apart like seafood and nuts so they can easily fall into the tray next to each other unknowingly contaminating it! I reccomend you go to the new Buffet in Roselle Park instead!"

But I literally just ordered from there an order of cream cheese wontons and General Tso's, but when it got here I noticed it had crab in the wontons, even though I didn't order crab anything (I can't eat crab, I'm allergic to it) so I called them up and told the lady on the phone and her response was that ""cream cheese wontons and crab ragoons are the same thing"" even though they are 2 separate items on the menu. So yeah, I'm pretty pissed off about this, considering I spent 5$ to get something that I can't even eat.
I want to be clear that nowhere on the menu does it day that cream cheese wontons have crab in them, or I would have ordered something else."

The dumplings were AMAZING - really unique flavor, sweet, herbacious, light, and aromatic - I will 100% be ordering them again. The crab was simply delicious - very fresh tasting and excellently prepared with that crispy crunch I crave and the sauce paired with it perfectly too. The pork was succulent and juicy with a crackling skin and came with lettuce and sauces to wrap bite-size pieces up in. It was all very good and I can't wait to come back and share with friends."
China Dragon,Florida,St. Petersburg,Uhuh T,2,"Ordered through grubhub. Food arrived hot, but the seafood hot and sour soup was ""seafood"" in that there were exactly 2 small shrimp in a large soup.

Super Wok,North Carolina,Cary,Joel Abrahams,5,"I always have a good meal with Super Wok. I recommend their spicy fish dishes. I've had their eggplant in the past and really enjoyed it too. Hopefully post Covid the dining area comes back to life. It's usually a bad sign when a restaurant turns their dining area into some food prep/warehouse space and is usually a sign of a decling restaurant. Before Covid the dining area would be packed durng lunch for the number of times I went there.
Besides that it's easily one of the tops for Chinese food in the area."

I said I would not lie but he kept being rude. He called the waitress and she could not tell him weather they did or didn't and the whole time the guy was very rude. I finally said I even told the lady before we walk in they were not eating. He then turns to her and she said yes that's true. He then goes to being very ugly to her because she should not have wrote 4/2 on ticket. He did say sorry one time very rudely and I told the one girl I was sorry because he treated her very bad in front of others not to mention the intimidation and embarrassment he was trying to pull on me.

Bamboo Garden Restaurant,North Carolina,Charlotte,Fabio Murillo,1,I ordered 3 chicken br√≥coli with white rice.. And we were really disappointed... The brown sauce they use for the chicken/br√≥coli is basically water with soy sauce.. Its not thick whatsoever.. It's just a brown water basically.. And the taste of it didn't help either. They need to Google a good brown sauce recipe it's that easy.

Golden Garden Restaurant,South Carolina,Mt Pleasant,Min Zhang,5,"(Translated by Google) The most authentic Chinese restaurant in Charleston is the only place where you can make fried peppers and tofu in your hometown. Although it is still mixed with American characteristics, you can tell the boss that it is more appetizing to let them follow the domestic taste.

Red Pepper Chinese and Vietnamese Cuisine,New York,Amherst,Sue Raichilson,5,"The service here is very efficient and fast. Our party of 5 Had a combination of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes. The fresh rolls and Vietnamese egg rolls were delicious. Our main dinners were Mongolian beef, chicken and eggplant in a garlic sauce, sweet-and-sour chicken, beef lo mein and the red pepper special dinner.  None of the dishes disappointed‚Ä¶ everything is of high quality and  Generous servings. At the end of the dinner they serve oranges as well as the traditional fortune cookies. The red pepper is one of our go to places for good quality Chinese and Vietnamese food."

China City,North Carolina,Thomasville,Misty Branscome,1,Ordered over $30 in food one item was wrong and an other item was wrong size. I was charged for large and I received a half empty container. Two employees told me that I was wrong that I did order what they sent me... refused to not charge me for the one item.. was willing to pay for the rest. Delivery was 20 mins late... I use to order food from them regularly and stoped because the food went down hill. Decided to give them an other chance.. that won't happen again... sorry that you lost a good customer over your own mistake...
Cozy Room Chinese Restaurant,New Jersey,North Brunswick Township,Mel,2,The orange chicken and basil rice are okay. The pad Thai is god awful. Everything is greasy and slightly soggy. If you want your food spicy ask for extra hot sauce. Workers are nice & food is packaged well.
China Star,New York,Ogdensburg,Tri Pe,2,"Had to come in because when I called I was hung up on and then no answer. Found out why: Only two unhappy looking people (a couple?) working the kitchen, phones, and cash register. Waited an hour for some nasty food. They ignored my husband when he was trying to get updates on the food situation.

The savory dishes had a weird taste, like maybe they went overboard on the MSG. It‚Äôs gotta be tough being Asian up here, if they won‚Äôt hire anyone why not cut your losses and open up shop somewhere you‚Äôd be happier? In the meantime go to your freezer section of your grocery store; better Chinese food there."
Hot Mustard,South Carolina,Charleston,LB Rhys,1,"The place was nasty, trays, tables and floors all sticky. The food tasted spoiled. The oil they used to cook with tasted like it was burnt and had not been changed in a very long time. My ""seaseame chicken"" was not seaseame chicken, that's my go to dish at any Chinese place and what they gave us was not it. But again, it tasted spoiled anyway. Don't go there and waste your money."

Yan's Chinese Buffet,New York,Delmar,Quaisha Thornton,3,"This was my first time at this restaurant. I went about 30-45 minutes before closing. Upon entering the restaurant, you can see down the aisle the buffet. It looks as though it's double sided, like there's a continuation of the buffet on the other side. When we approached the buffet, it was only a mirror showing a reflection, and only had one side of food. There isn't many options like Dragon Buffet has. The pricing didn't reflect it either. They charged a little more than what I would have paid. The food was ok but I definitely won't be going back due to the price."

Jade Garden III,Virginia,Virginia Beach,Javier Garcon,4,"I would like to give a 5 star, I visit each Chinese restraint which are many here in Virginia Beach, the egg roll broke the camels back and if they improve that I will add a 5th star. I always order Genral Tso Chicken and Chicken fried rice. If that goes well then I come back and order Mongolian beef, fried vegetable noodles and spring roll. I usually start a restraint at 5 stars, if each meal is missing so.ething a star is taken away. The place is clean! Tables are clean and the people are polite but like all chinese people they are direct and to the point! Never deduct a star because how they where raised that's just racist! They take a lot of pride here. I can not wait for round two, probably be back tomorrow."
China King Restaurant V,Virginia,Falls Church,Emily Santiago,1,"This place needs to stop acting like everyone wants a lunch special. I order from the regular menu so I can share with the family the order consisted of beef human, combination lo main, spare rib tips and what they did was that instead of putting the steam white rice separate they put the steam rice in the same container as the Hunan beef makes no sense I told the lady at the counter that it should of been separate and she said that's how we serve every item with the rice next to it,  if I pay regular price for my item why serve it like a lunch spacial the food TASTED JUST LIKE GREASE OIL NOT GOOD AFTER TASTE.  The spare rib tips was just bones only NOT RECOMMENDED THIS ESTABLISHMENT HAS CHANGED ALOT FROM 5 YEARS AGO."

Cumin N Eat,New Jersey,Secaucus,Vikram Moorjani,1,"Overpriced for the quality and quantity of food they serve, ordered take out the food took an hour to come and it was cold as turkey. The Chicken 65 was over fried and had no taste. They charge you a delivery fee of $4 and ask for a tip that's a joke. $4 fee within a radius of 2 miles is not justified. Will never order or visit the place as you make a mistake once. Visit at your own risk."

A sit down restaurant! I guess I'm spoiled when it comes to my lunch meal deal's! I tried that place and I was disappointed with Wang's Kitchen, maybe I was expecting something different!

I now always mention this allergy wherever I go, especially for Asian restaurants to be safe. Bad experience, BUT, the food really was very good and we had a great time. I didn't get hit with the reaction until after dinner was over, and the waiter caught this detail halfway through our meal and made sure to adapt our order to bring items that were safe for me."

China HouseÔºàNew LondonÔºâ,Connecticut,New London,C Fam,1,"By far the worst customer service experience ever I have been going to this place since I was little and it has been my second time as an adult with my children and the service was less than one star the ladies were rude when I asked about an order that was not ready yet that belonged  to a customer that ordered about 15 minutes prior to me then they got upset when I asked for Paper plates because we were dining in, she then proceeded to roll her eyes and turned around to the rest of the kitchen staff and speak in their language, In which she then turn back around and I‚Äôll get hold her eyes only because I needed paper plates and silverware for myself and my children."
Fire Wok Chinese Restaurant,Maryland,Arbutus,Manuel Jimenez,5,"Super fast delivery!

Called the lady on the phone was sweet and helped with the order. The food was great Mambo sauce was different then I was use to back in Silver springs but just as good. Wings and orange chicken were on point."
China Panda,Georgia,Norcross,Talons_mommy,1,"Will never eat here again. We ordered on Uber eats. We ordered 1 hour before they closed figuring it would be enough time but I guess this place rushes the last hour orders and/or just gives the customer what‚Äôs left sitting at the bottom of the stove. We ordered a meal that is suppose to be made mainly of noodles with vegetables and chicken included. The meal came with only chicken and vegetables and the noodles were missing all together (you don‚Äôt order it in pieces either, it‚Äôs the name of the meal and how it‚Äôs suppose to be made). The dish had zero favor and the chicken and vegetables were sitting in water, soggy. The vegetable egg rolls I ordered were good but very tiny in size. The crab ragoon filling was good but there wasn‚Äôt a lot of filling in each piece. We had ordered a side of fried rice so we attempted to put the rice and chicken and vegetables on our stove top to try and fix it. We had to add salt, pepper, other seasonings and also heat it because it arrive almost cold. In the end we threw it away and I asked for a refund (we arnt picky eaters either). I have never seen thin, soggy lettuce thrown into a Asian cuisine either but I guess they were desperate to add to what they had left for the night to serve us without making anything fresh. Me and my bf actually sat there crying laughing because it was so bad and we had to question what was in the dish. The ‚Äúchicken‚Äù had a rubbery bland texture as well. We ordered at 9pm on 8-14-19. Whoever was working that shift should honestly be fired. We won‚Äôt be ordering here again. Gross."

The only thing I enjoy from their occasionally is their thai iced tea which by the way for the price, the portion is terrible. It is 90% ice and 10% tea. There is a place down the street I went with one of my friends where the price was way less and you actually get the amount you pay for.

No 1 Taste,Maryland,Baltimore,Hector Carrion,2,So let me first start with the delivery service which I found to be the best part. Driver was nice and very polite. The food was terrible. Worst dumplings I‚Äôve ever had. The chicken curry sauce dinner special was terrible. Basically a dish of onions and peppers.....I couldn‚Äôt find the meat. Absolutely no spice and even when I found chicken it was terrible. Even the doing role tasted bad. Save your money and go to another Chinese spot.
Chung Shing Chinese Take-Out,New York,Baldwin,Carolina,4,"Chinese takeout is chinese takeout. On this trip, things were not overdone, tasted fresh. Normal cou ter crew not there for a couple of months. Counter person from another local restaurant. I guess same person owns both locations. She's fairly friendly. Doesn't overcharge on tax as many do. Ordered beef fried rice, chicken wings and shrimp with broccoli. Not much shrimp, but they were fairly large. Rice was tasty, not dry."

They had me tell them my card number to pay with card to lessen contact and i picked up my food in the window and signed my cc slip there.

Food was great. Very inner-city Chinese food but not excessively greasy like I've experienced elsewhere.

Lunch combos are affordable and come with fried rice and a choice of soup,egg roll or a soda. Which i haven't seen in a while.

Will definitely be my Monday chinese spot."

China Star,New York,Rochester,rickter 58,3,"Usually good but don't get sesame or general tso chicken its always fishy tasting! Obviously China Star does not change their cooking oil used for frying fish, which goes right into other food. They don't care what it does with strong fish taste permeating through non-fish items.  This could be a serious issue for people with allergies to fish or seafood! Happened to me twice in a row. Figured I would chance it one more time today but no change obviously. Anything to save money it seems. After calling to complain I was told the cooking oil from previous day was still being used then got suddenly hung up on. Never order general tso or sesame chicken from them if you don't like fishy tasting food! They hate credit cards here so you better have cash. Probably to get around the state taxes."

Taste wise, the shrimp didn‚Äôt taste fresh and was a bit chewy. Wasn‚Äôt awful, but wasn‚Äôt worth the $15 price tag. Wontons were stuffed pretty well. However, taste wise, it was pretty bland and the crab inside didn‚Äôt taste fresh. Not sure if I will be back again. Just because the taste and presentation isn‚Äôt worth the price in my opinion."

Food here is usually good.   Last time I had ordered a large Wonton soup which this was one of my favorite Chinese places to get it.   The broth was watery and not flavorful.   I mentioned this to the waitress who didn't seem to care.   Service has been slow the last two times and seating temperature were way too hot inside.   I saw a post of owner change.

New Orient Buffet & Grill,Maryland,Cumberland,Kenneth Haught,4,"Hibachi bar was very fresh and clean, as was the sushi bar. Ice cream was a little freezer burnt but clean in appearance. Service was quick and overall appearance was very clean for the lunch service."

Dragon City Chinese Kitchen,New York,Jamaica,Richard Ortiz,2,Was my first time had to throw out my food the oil used was not fresh.  Cash Only which they do not tell you.  Even though it has an A üåü on the front window come in and eat the food for yourself.

Panda Garden,North Carolina,Chapel Hill,Cleibe Souza,5,Great place for a quick bite or take out. Their orange chicken is delicious.
No 1 Restaurant,Virginia,Gloucester,James Compagnone,4,"It's cheap Chinese food that is still decent quality and the portions are decently sized. It's like 8 bucks for a main dish and a side of rice, so everyone can get what they want and still have left overs that you will inevitably eat 2 hours after eating dinner."
P.F. Chang's,Virginia,Newport News,Anthony Hiltz,5,Great place
China Express,North Carolina,Matthews,Tommy Beatty,5,They get a 5 when it comes to fast food Chinese. Always busy. Seldom a wait. Always good.
Mandarin House,Massachusetts,Roslindale,niquiepoo,4,Their food is so good! It looks a little raggedy but the food makes it worth the trip. Best chicken and fries ever.
P.F. Chang's,North Carolina,Durham,Mark Kraska,3,Decent food no msg so doesn't have enhanced flavor of regular american chinese. Probably close to authentic but not that good tasting
Buddakan,New York,New York,Gilbert Martinez,5,"I was pleasantly surprised. Made a reservation for 8:15 pm and was seated within 5 minutes. The waitress was very informative about the menu options. Food is served family-style so I had a chance to try multiple dishes. To drink, I had the Royal cocktail (I'm an Austinite who loves his Tito's vodka). To start, we had the Edamame Dumplings - they tasted like potato pierogies - and I was expecting a crunch but was surprised with the smooth, palatable interior texture. The Charred Filet was my favorite - it packed a lot of flavor. The Wild Mushroom noodles were delicious, as were the Wok Charred Broccoli. For dessert, I had the Spiced Carrot Cake - OMG! Perfect size and the perfect end to a great meal! Thanks for a great experience, Buddakan!"
New China Buffet,North Carolina,Winston-Salem,Brittany Rockette,1,"Not my cup of tea. While this restaurant is clean, there is not much of a variety like you have with other buffets. Certain foods, such as seafood and chicken are placed together on the buffet and the smell of both at one time is sickening. The food tastes like it was made a few days ago, then put out for customers to eat."

Hong Kong,New Jersey,North Bergen,Tanya D. Lopez,5,Best chinese food hands down.
Foobao Steam & Delicious Restaurant,Maryland,Catonsville,bill cozzo,5,"We really enjoyed Foobao. The place was bright and clean. We were warmly greeted as soon as we walked in and offered help if we had any questions. We had never been to a place like this but had done a little research. We first ordered wonton soup which was good. Foobao's version is more subtle than wonton soup we've had at any other Chinese restaurant. The wrapper is delicate and the broth much less heavy and less salty but with a nice understated flavor. We ordered a plate of steamed pork dumplings which were good too. If you are use to fried dumplings, these might underwhelm, but without such expectations, they were quite tasty. We ordered 5 different types of bao and all had a soft (but not soggy or mushy) wrapper. The fillings we tried were chicken/corn,  pork, vegetable, beef/cheese, and sweet potato. Again, the bao were subtly flavored and the ratio of wrapper to filling was a little higher than we might've expected. The sweet potato was a particular treat, almost dessert-like. Only one of us managed to finish 2 whole baos because they are large and dense especially after soup & dumplings. The price is extremely reasonable - 3 of us ate like royalty with enough left to carry-home for another meal for just over $30. We will definitely go back again to try some of the rice, noodle, etc. Dishes. Highly recommend!"

Chopstick House,Florida,Melbourne,Sam Irvin,5,The food is fresh and delicious. They prepare it when you order so no food sitting in warmers so it might take a bit longer than fast food but it's worth the wait. Authentic and Americanized Chinese food available. We really like the bourbon chicken and their version of orange chicken. The eat-in area is small and hot so it's really best to order there and take it home or to a park and eat.

This is not PF Changs so i dunno why people complain bout the service. Its your regular Chinese corner spot get your food and go!!! i order from here 3 to 4 times a week and Food Quality is what matters.

Genghis Grill,Florida,Brandon,Suesan Darabian,2,Over priced and the managers and servers were eyeball you and how much you put in the bowl. The desserts are super tiny and very expensive.

Harry's Place,Connecticut,Colchester,Chris Petersen,5,"Harry's is a tradition. Or it should be. It is the classic roadside stand. Burgers made fresh, clams, lobster rolls, and assorted specials. Worth going out of the way for. They are a cash only business, which used to bother me, but now they've installed an ATM machine at the counter.  Whether you are stopping for lunch or just a shake or ice cream you will enjoy."

I have ordered from the place a few times and I am happy with the food and portion size.  I would like to see the atmosphere improve a little.  I see so much space that is not really noticable.  I would like to see it as a sun room to have a outdoor indoor feeling.

Lucky Bento V.I.P Cuisine,New York,Flushing,Raymond Kong,4,"I will definitely go back. They provide an unique Chinese food experience. Talk to the waiter/ waitress about how dishes may be prepared. They can definitely customize as well. They are worthy the slightly higher price.  Their menu selection appears to be limited, but that is because each dish is a specialty (hence the word ""VIP"" on their restaurant name.) A good balance of spicy and non-spicy dishes. Both are equally good. The ""medium"" size is just half of the ""big"" size. Go for latter unless you are on a weight-loss diet or you just want to try-out a dish."

Anyway don't ever order their lobster sauce because I don't know what other Chinese restaurant goes pepper happy. Plus the time I ate it was cold because I was still eating the soup.

The prices were manageable, would recommend and would return !"

Always nice and clean. Prices are average for Chinese. We order from here,at least every other week. The only thing that isn't good (and I'm a food critic when it comes to these) are the egg rolls, they precook them and they're gross. I like fresh food and I'm all for prepping but don't precook food that's loaded with msg."

Old Shanghai Soup Dumplings,New Jersey,Palisades Park,Tommy Chen,4,Newly opened and serving excellent Shanghai food. Limited indoor dining and takeout at the moment and 10% discount for grand opening. Most of of their food hold up well for takeout with the exception being the soup dumplings. You really need to have it as soon as possible because the skin gets very dry fast. The meat balls are probably my favorite dish that I‚Äôve had here but everything is very tasty and affordable. Definitely worth trying if you are in the area.

Ginger & Garlic Chinese & Sushi Restaurant,Florida,Rockledge,J Q,3,"Service was excellent,  and friendly.

Asian Express,Georgia,Marietta,cassundra Jones,2,I stopped going to this restaurant before the virus because the quality of the food has gone down. But decided to give it a try again today and was very very disappointed. I saw the cook put my chicken in what looked like a steamer which would explain why it was very dried out(must have been left over from lunch)also my spring roll was overcooked. Needless to say I won't be returning.

I bit into it and it was dough and the meat was raw. Ordered crispy noodles and that did not arrive in the order either. They also did not provide any utensils or napkins.

They offer delivery.
Better than China King in the sense that at least you can pick up your order,  China King is delivery only
Otherwise I  think the quality of food is probably about the same
Certainly not as appetizing as it once was.
For a little extra they will add more meat to the fried rice
Too much debris left in customer section.

I work on the building that it's in and I don't really take a lunch hour so my options are limited. It's weird how the current printing of the menu has no phone number to call to order to pick it up. I know it from previous menus/can look it up online but when I asked why, they said they have a 2nd location and people call the wrong number to order from the wrong place. That's a really stupid reason. Just say when they call where they are calling so they know. I don't get it."

Though we waited about 45 minutes or more for an order that was supposed to take 20-25 minutes, it wouldn't have mattered had I not been over charged for food I didn't receive.

The first order they gave me wasn't mine, then they gave me most of my order and part of someone else's. The food was VERY bland and the sushi was meh. Now I have the headache of disputing this mess with my bank. Not worth the wait at all."

Chopstix Express Cuisine,New Jersey,Dumont,Christine Robert,4,"Friendly staff, it's a cute place and very clean. Hoping they get outdoor seating. Not your typical greasy Chinese fare, at least what we ordered.
Scallion pancake - really liked this - usually they're so greasy, this was not. Only criticism was it didn't come with a dipping sauce.
Hot & sour soup was good - more hot than sour if it matters to anyone.
Chicken & broccoli used a lighter brown sauce than you usually get, received a thumbs up. The broccoli had a slightly weird taste would be our only criticism.
Vegetable yakisoba, pleasantly surprised - was expecting typical lo mein, but received a stir fry using light noodles and yakisoba sauce. It could have used a little more sauce, but it was still tasty. A great break from lo mein.
Thai chicken was a substantial stir fry, and though spicy it wasn't overbearing, and the sauce was light and on the sweeter side.
Overall we were very pleased, and look forward to trying other items on the menu."

The kitchen is well-staffed, so there are no delays. The counter staff is well-informed on the menu and makes ordering very easy and pleasant.

We continue to enjoy Golden China, because of their consistency. Great people who have run a great restaurant for many years.

My shrimp with cashews contained plenty of jumbo shrimp and crunchy crisp cashew nuts. And it's so nice to see this dish not drowning in tons of sauce like so many other places. Their subgum wonton soup was excellent, as was their Singapore mei fun and their cold sesame noodles."
Xiang Yu China Bistro,Massachusetts,Brookline,Gabor Lippner,2,"Great food but extremely slow, or what is more likely simply ignoring online orders. But then why offer it?!  Waiting 30 mins at 4:30pm for an order of dumplings and noodles doesn't seem reasonable."

I try something new off the menu every time I go and have NEVER been disappointed in the choices.  It's all so good...  I have never had a bad experience the few times I've gone there to eat ""in house"".  Always leave a generous tip.  If you love Chinese food and like a little bit of variety, then by all means, go to the great wall.  The other local Chinese Restaurants in the Olean area ""fail"" by comparison to the Great Wall."

King's Taste,New York,East Elmhurst,Amy lin,4,"I've wanted to here since I was a kid.  And I wasn't disappointed.  The decor is reminiscent of the twenties.  It's a bit over the top in decor but that's what I hoped for and was not disappointed.

The staff was very good.  The hostess was kind enough to bring us upstairs to see the glass bear.  I think it would be fun to sit up there and drink some cocktails.

The food was very good.  I had the mushroom stuffed crepe to start, followed by the chicken Kiev, which was fairly good.  A bit salty but enjoyable.

I had the Prince Vladymir tea, which was excellent.  Citrus, vanilla and spices oh my! Topped off with some cherries.

I definitely recommend if you're looking for a bit of romance and nostalgia."
Top's China Chinese Restaurant,North Carolina,High Point,Carlton Grady,5,So far the best egg foo young I've had. They also give a free cup of tea with your order.
Jasmine Buffet,South Carolina,Columbia,ian kornmeyer,2,"Jasmine Buffet is exactly what it advertises - an oriental buffet. Take it or leave it, they live up to that standard.

Food: you can eat sushi (for an extra $1 per 2 pieces), traditional San Francisco  Chinese foods (sweet and sour chicken, everything but the table fried, deserts, 4 different soups, Japanese dishes (teriyaki chicken, no tempura), salad bar (all the traditional trappings, potato salad, pasta salad), and a few Southern treats like crawfish.

Service: there was a poor, mumbled hand-off between our English-speaking hostess and the young man who was tending our section and likely only spoke Cantonese. We tried to ask a few basic questions (Do we just go grab plates?)  and were met with a non-comprehending smile and then he left.  He was johnny-on-the-spot with our refills, but we were left completely to fend for ourselves for everything else.

Restaurant interior: our table was mostly clean. The carpet in the entire restaurant is basically brown. Not a big deal until you notice that it is supposed to have a light pattern that can only be seen within about 8"" of a wall.

Overall: I'm glad we tried it. The selection was remarkably broad and seemed fresh (if slightly overcooked, at times). The cleanliness of the restaurant makes me suspicious that the food will come back to haunt me."

Don't think I'll be back. Also they don't deliver and you can't even sit and eat cause they have no tables"

Eatzy Chinese,New York,Queens,Mumenur Chowdhury,2,"Honestly speaking, there are way better chinese fusion places out there. First I ordered their chicken lollypops and they were really really small in size for 6 picies. Than I ordered the chicken tikka masala and when it came out it was way to tart in flavor and just full of chunks of onions. Which chicken tikka masala shouldn't have. Also I ordered there Hakkah Noodles and it was straight up just regular ramen that has been cooked with egg and some chopped chicken and frozen shrimp, did not taste good at all. Lastly I ordered there Sizzling shrimp with their mixed Fried rice  which consisted of chicken and shrimp which was decent in taste but had to much batter on the shrimps and they were not cleaned properly.  The fried rice was the only thing that tasted really good. Also their menu is extremely large and very difficult to choose from because of the fact that most items repeat the same dishes. The positive side is that the staff is very friendly and dishes come out pretty quick. In all I recommend you try somewhere elsewhere just wasn't for me."

Hot N Roll Hot Pot,Maryland,Ellicott City,Wendy Gao,4,"This is a decent AYCE hotpot place in Ellicott City. I always get the mushroom soup which is really flavorful, and the servers are super attentive. The sauce bar is a little small, and the selections are okay... sometimes the selection wasnt refilled when empty. However, there is a large selection of seafood including fish balls, shrimp, squid, mussels, and oysters. There are also a large selection of veggies such as snow peas top, spinach, corn, and potatoes."
Ginger & Garlic Chinese & Sushi Restaurant,Florida,Rockledge,Charles,4,"Authentic little place, reasonably priced and they even have some pretty good sake.
Had Buddha's Delight, which was a smaller plate of veggies than I need, but it was very tasty and not overcooked.

Eastern Moon,Georgia,Lake Park,laura brown,1,I called them to make a pickup order. The man who answered the phone was very rude I understand that maybe they are busy but that is not the way to treat a potential consumer on the phone. He was very rude and could not speak good English to start with and when I tried to place my order and ask if they took a local check he just said no thank you and hung up the phone I used to like this place and their food and that is why I called them because I did enjoy their food but the last couple of times I have ordered from them they were very rude I would not recommend getting food for your dog from this place.

Unfortunately we won't order from there again. Hate to put a damper on any business trying to make a living but it is what it is and we spent 45 dollars only to be disappointed and couldn't even finish eating the food it was that bad. Very bland food."

Fung Chinese Restaurant,Connecticut,Hartford,miguel rodriguez,4,Great food.
Great Wall Chinese Restaurant,New Jersey,Dumont,Jer Brack,1,"Very bad! The food was just very bad. The boneless spare ribs were these large chunks of meat that have a bad taste and are very difficult to chew. The sweet & sour chicken also had a bad taste. And the sesame chicken equally bad. The sweet sauce on both of the chickens had a bad taste. Either the 3 meats were leftovers reheated, or the meat company selling meats to this restaurant is giving them bad food. If that is the case, they need to find a new meat source provider. On top of that, the rice was dry and overcooked, possibly leftover from a day or 2 and reheated. I honestly havent tasted chinese white rice this bad before. Rice is suppossed to be fluffy and light, so simple. This was just really bad food in all types.

The hostess barely spoke to us and was rude in her tone of voice. She looked grumpy which is not good if you are in the food service industry. Prices were on the expensive side. No fortune cookies, despite eating inside and ordering a lot of food.

On the good side, they have lots of tables and the dining room is clean. Just no edible food here and from the attitude of the employees, they dont want customers."

For a restaurant with its price range, cleanness is somewhat a minimum requirement. For the the visit today, the tofu was slightly sour. It means that it was not fresh. The same goes for the noodles. It seems that the noodles is not fresh either. It is not likely that I will go back to this restaurant by my own choice. They also charge for the spice oil and spices package that were not used. The other food quality and taste is okay, but for the price they are charging, overall quality should be better."

No big deal on the wait but just dissatisfied with the lie/cover up. Then there was a roach crawling up the ladies bathroom wall on the last stall.

Cafe Q,Georgia,Johns Creek,Barbara Pailet,4,"It is good Chinese food. Best fried rice my husband has had in YEARS. We got the family dinner for 2 worth egg drop soup & fried rice.

I really liked the sweet & sour chicken, the sauce didn't taste canned and was flavorful without being overbearing. The chicken was a little on the dry side for my taste, but not unbearable at all.

My least favorite element was the spring roll. It was meh. Not horrible, but not good either (a little bland)"

CHEN'S CHINESE RESTAURANT,South Carolina,Lexington,Thomas Warren,1,My wife just brought home what is supposed to be General Tsos chicken but doesn't even resemble it. The sauce isn't the right flavor or color and to boot its supposed to be extra spicy. The rice does not resemble fried rice and the noodles look like Dcollar General $1 ramen. How can this place have any good ratings? Apparently people don't know what real Chinese food is. Very dissatisfied.

Panda Express,Maryland,Baltimore,Matt Frock,1,"They have the same problem as all the others, they never have Super Greens ready/prepared. For some reason Panda deems it necessary to have 10 lbs of rice and 10lbs of lo-mein ready at all times, but Super Greens...it'll be 5 minutes. Not everyone wants to carb-load on rice/noodles. Get your greens right.
My 2nd review for this location...even worse. Again no super greens ready. Rice old and overcooked. Entrees looked several hours old. This is the worst Panda. THE WORST"

Hai Hong Restaurant,New York,Ithaca,CJ McDermith,2,"The waitress was in a very poor mood complaining and cursing throughout. Probably just having a bad day. But on top of this I had to play the classic game of where's the meat. I ordered general tso chicken and it was 70% fat and most all of the actual chicken was dark meat. While this may be typical for fast food I was disappointed given the total of over $40 for two entrees and an appetizer (no drinks and no deserts). I should also add that the steamed dumplings we ordered as an appetizer came after I had already finished my entree... very disappointed with the quality at this price point. The restaurant itself was nice, very clean. If you do go read the story on the front of the menu, it's worth the read."

Quality: Excellent

Credit Cards: No, CASH ONLY

Service: Quick, although it was quite when I went in.

Ambiance: Nice and relaxed. Decent wood furniture and easy to read chalk menu. Music at a reasonable volume, and of course - clean.

Clientele: Mixed reflecting the neighborhood, but most importantly I see actual Asian people eating here.

What I had: Spicy Beef Dumplings and Pork with Cilantro Dumplings. I had both fried instead of steamed. They were meaty, flavorful, and crispy.

Bonus: They are partnered with SpotLuck"

Yan's Chinese Buffet,New York,Delmar,Eric Spagli,5,"I have had chinese all over albany,glenmont,schenectady,ravena and if you are looking for classic american chinese food you are not going to find it elsewhere, the buffet is small and cheap that is not what I am reviewing. Yan's is literally the only chinese place out of a dozen I have tried in the past year that will actually listen when you ask for your food to be cooked a certain way. You wouldn't think it is difficult to make general tso spicy like it is meant to be and not fried chicken swimming in sugar glaze but somehow Yan's is the only place to figure it out.

I will say if you are looking for american chinese that is overloaded with sugar and sauce this is not the place to go, but to me that is exactly why I like it."

King Chinese Buffet,North Carolina,Garner,Crystal Singletary,1,"Granted, I did go in about 45 minutes before closing but still... the experience could‚Äôve been much better. I started writing this as I waited for my check and watched the staff clean the restaurant.

The staff started taking items off of the bar at least 30 minutes before closing. The majority of the remaining items were already cold. The food probably wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad if it was fresh and hot.

My server came to my table twice while I was actually at the table‚Äî once to drop off the check and once to bring back my to-go drink (which I had to ask for as she walked away). Not sure if she was just too preoccupied with cleaning or if she is rude. She did seem to have time to goof off with the hibachi cook though, so hey. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The environment was not welcoming. Even when I went to the hibachi station, the cook made a weird face at the server. So, I asked if the hibachi station was still open and he reluctantly said yes. Then I saw a gnat fly into the pineapples at the hibachi station.ü§¢üò∑ I went to the sushi station but all of the sushi has already been removed. The cashiers began to remove the items from the hibachi station soon after.

I‚Äôve worked in a restaurant with a buffet before, so I understand that the employees need to begin some of the closing duties before the restaurant closes; however, it is in extremely poor tastes to start removing items from the buffet before the restaurant closes‚Äî especially when the main attraction is the buffet.

Also, they mopped the floor at the entrance and failed to put up a wet floor sign near the door. The cashier warned me about the wet floor as I left, but someone coming in from the outside would have to cross the wet floor without a warning.

On a positive note, the cashier was friendly. Also, the bathroom was clean. I still want my money back though."

While small, it is extremely clean and the staff very helpful and nice. I had a coupon for a free lunch and decided it was time to try the food. It is somewhere between a real Chinese restaurant and the standard far food Chinese. I had the General Tao's chicken and fried rice. The chicken was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crunch, the fried rice was delicious and included broccoli. There was so much food I couldn't even eat it all. The drawbacks are that you get a can or bottle of soda, no refills and your plate and utensils are paper and plastic. However, the food is good, reasonably priced with large portions."
China Garden Restaurant,North Carolina,Fayetteville,Raquel McClenny,3,The food was okay apart from some of it being cold and others being burnt. It took 2 hours for me to get my food despite being less than a quarter mile from the store. Although the delivery driver was very polite and even told me I paid too much when I gave him his tip. The young lady at the front counter was very polite when I called to inquire about my food as well. I will probably return but it won't be my first choice.

Hong Kong Chinese Restaurant,Georgia,Columbus,Cindy Moores,3,"Accidentally Vegan Friendly

Little place conveniently near the base and just off the highway. The food quality is good-the vegetables cooked to perfection and fresh. They were out of tofu so I could not get a tofu substitution for meat like I normally get.

I had the mixed vegetables and asked for spicy garlic sauce instead of the menu sauce and it was good. Nice and thick and enough of it for the generous portion of rice.

This little family owned business is not fancy but has a very polite staff who has some difficulty with English. Don‚Äôt come here for atmosphere-basic surroundings, clearly mostly a take out but does have limited seating. Glad we stopped for lunch."

New China,North Carolina,Durham,Alan Hendricker,3,"New owners/cooks as of approximately April 2018. Will re-review. Still the same standard cheap Chinese menu but also they have Thai food now!  Updated to 3 stars until I try a few things but it can't be worse than before.

Updated in October 2018. I was really hopeful. Gave this place about six separate spaced out chances but the food is just ok. And at not quite fast food quality and prices you can‚Äôt be slow. You have to do one thing well. I really believe they are trying here but you just can‚Äôt take 40 minutes to make fried rice.

Maybe some of the basil fried rice is worth your time. The curry is not great. A few of the chicken dishes (honey chicken) are ok. But east Durham still suffers for a good Chinese place it seems."

China Kitchen,New York,Buffalo,Brigitte Almonor,1,"The same day that I gave them a raving, good review, I called ahead to order & pick up. They have a very mean-spirited manager who told me I took too long to pick up my order & he had sold my food to someone else. Mind you, he doesn't speak English so well, so he kept screaming: ""I said '10 min'!"" to me & slamming the window in my face. (Their website says that they close at 11:30pm on Sat. night BUT IT'S 11pm. Woww‚Äã!!!) The 1 star üåü is because their food is good."

Golden City III,Virginia,Virginia Beach,Mimi Kwak,5,"Yum yum yum I'm Chinese American and I eat there like every other day. Most of the time they can cater to what I like so I know for sure they make it fresh each time. You can tell because it has an open kitchen. I like extra broccoli or other things in my meal and they can cater to that, which is wonderful. A lot of places have one size portion for all but their menu has different portions on most entrees other than specialties and the veggie entree. When I go there around 5:30 pm and it was fine but if I go later in know they are busy and things take a tab bit longer. Overall I like this place a lot and the food tastes great"

China Panda,New York,Scottsville,Joanna (Concerned consumer),1,"I stumbled onto this restaurant while enjoying a Sunday outing with my family.  The food was satisfactory (note: not stellar, just satisfying) and I brought it home to eat.  My family ordered from somewhere else.  The next time I ordered, same circumstances, I ordered for the entire family because they wanted to try the restaurant.  The bill came to ~$60.00.  We brought it home.  My son asked if they applied the 10% (which would have came to approximately a $6.00 credit) incentive  they advertise on their circular.  I looked at the receipt and realized they did not.  So, I called to find out why and was told that I had to mention it when ordering.  I apologized for the oversight and asked could they apply the credit.  The manager blatantly said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.  Needless to say, I would not be purchasing from this restaurant again.  It‚Äôs not the $6.00 that concerns me, it‚Äôs the fact that they advertise an incentive and they do not automatically apply it to orders.  It is their incentive, why should the responsibility be on the consumer?"
Peking Kitchen,New York,Bronx,Stephany J. Cervantes,2,"Food is okay...ordered shrimp and broccoli. They are light on the sauce and could have been  seasoned a bit more. The spring rolls were lacking flavor. Also, after charging me $1.25, they forgot my fortune cookies.  Overall, good packaging for mediocre food."

Buffalo China,Georgia,Stone Mountain,Jeannie Polanco,2,This was such a terrible experience. The chicken in my chicken and broccoli was tough and dried out. I ordered a large pork fried rice and there was more rice than anything. They put like a tablespoon of meat in it. My husband ordered garlic chicken and the chicken was also tough and dried out. All this mess for $27! SMH. I ordered a large Sprite and paid the extra .30 for what I thought was a large to only get a 16.9oz... WTH??? The only reason why I‚Äôm giving this 2 stars is because the flavor was ok and the egg roll was good and I didn‚Äôt have to wait long... I ordered through Uber Eats. Never again!

Buddakan,New York,New York,Andrew Fader,2,"The food was made from high quality ingredients and cooked very well. The service was good. The bill was $150 including tip for a cocktail, 2 orders of dumplings, 2 egg rolls, a chow fun with mushrooms, and a chili chicken entree. It was not Chinese food. It was American food with a ""thai chili"" hot wing sauce veneer. Other than that, it was almost completely tasteless, with nary a peppercorn of the promised ""Chinese pepper."" You can go to Ollie's Sichuan and pay a small fraction of the same price for a veritable Sichuan feast replete with leftovers. Maybe we should have ordered the more sushi-oriented items or more American ""fusion"" items as it was certainly fresh, not unhealthy, cooked to a high grade of quality, with nice-restaurant finishes including a traditional wait staff."
House of Cheung,Florida,Boca Raton,customerserviceshouldbe #1,1,"I just moved to boca and decided to try this place and I will never order from here again. I have never had a bad experience with sweet and sour chicken....who could mess up fried chicken. Well this place can. It tasted as if the meat was rancid and it most mostly fried flour. The fried rice was greasy...extremely greasy but yet the peas were hard as a rock. The chicken in the fried rice was questionable. This place isn't cheap either. The meal was close to 9.00 and there is a delivery charge to. All in all my entire order went straight to the trash. I also ordered chicken wings which weren't too bad, but again full of grease. The next day my stomach was really really upset that I ate anything from that place. With tip, delivery and food this experience cost me close to 30.00. Let's just say it cost me 30.00 to know that I will never ever eat from here...ever. Please save yourself and your stomach and go anywhere else!"

Sushi China Cafe,Georgia,Morrow,Danna Odum,1,Don't do it. Last two times I went I was given dirty dishes. Makes me wonder what I'm not seeing. California rolls have no flavor. Just say no.
Hong Kong Garden,Georgia,Lithonia,Jalen Lackey,3,The food is always fresh tasting and delicious. Shrimp fried rice comes with what seems like jumbo shrimp. The service is handled by small children which is kinda disappointing they even answer the phones which could get frustrating at times. Wait times can get pretty lengthy so I highly suggest you call your order in 20 mins in advance. Overall a decent spot. I would advise you to stay away from the egg fu young because they use a super sweet teriyaki sauce instead of gravy.
P.F. Chang's,Virginia,Newport News,Steven Monahan,4,Good place to go for family style neo Asian food. Price is a little above what I would consider appropriate for what you get. One thing they do have that I loved: trainer chopsticks for the little ones! How cool is that! Service is standard for a chain. Good restaurant overall.

Hang Wong,Maine,Millinocket,Tammy Diringer,5,Good food
Yi Palace,Delaware,Wilmington,Jamie,3,"I like the ambiance of this place and the adjustable lights at the tables. It's nice and quiet (though my sweetheart said it was TOO quiet - to each his own, I guess). The menu covers are strikingly beautiful and unique; however when you open them the innards don't match the outside. The food was good, but the problem is that it's pretty much the same as standard Chinese takeout... For about twice the price. Even though it was tasty, I would hesitate to return just for that reason. I also prefer fried rice with my entrees and they only offer brown/white rice."

Panda Express,New Jersey,Union,Amy Garges,4,"Love Panda Express food!  Staff was friendly and understood I didn‚Äôt want small portion of leftovers and happily scooped my portion out when the fresh batch came out.

At the time of check out, the cashier was dealing with a customer with a complaint and I had to wait a while to check out but the serving staff quickly jumped in and checked me out.

Slight complaint regarding safety protocols in light of COVID.  There could be better social distancing prompts on the floor.  It got crowded when I was there and would‚Äôve been good to have guidelines for people who do not know what 6 feet looks like!"

Genghis Grill - Build Your Own Stir Fry,Virginia,Chantilly,David Sabin,2,"If they didn't make you stand at the door for 5 minutes before they even acknowledge your presence and wait 15 for your drinks, it would be a good restaurant. It has good tasting food, but they should also work making the place smell better. I complained, and they tried to make it right, but when I came back, I got the same service as the first time. Maybe they have another location that I can try..."
China Maxim,Massachusetts,Brighton,Walter Holohan,5,"This place is REALLY GOOD, and a perfect example of why you should not judge the book by its cover. Definitely a take-out place, with the dingy front-end and plastic utensils. But ~~they have a Sanitary Grade of A!!!~~ which is better than most/all of your favorite fancy-atmosphere fine-dining places. (I'm talking to you, bad reviewers!!) And the kitchen is right behind the counter in full view and totally clean. Don't go here expecting friendly, American-type customer service in English. It is a tiny Chinese restaurant with older Chinese people working, they just want to give you the food and get the money and not have to speak English. But the food is always perfect, and I spend 1/2 of the money I would normally spend on dinner for two. That is actually what happens when a place doesn't spend anything on silverware/front end. Very great quality, price beats anywhere else, total hidden gem."
New Sing Lee Kitchen,New Jersey,Paterson,Michelle Canty,5,"Great Chinese food here. This store is one of my go to spots.  They deliver fairly quickly and I haven't had an issue with food from this location.  Love their Singapore mei fun dish. Again, very good food here."

New King's Wok Kitchen,New York,Bronx,Vivian Silverio,5,"Fast service chinese cooking in Bronx, NYC that has stayed open since the first COVID-19 restrictions were lifted on restaurants in spring-summer 2020. The table border at the door and the plastic shields over the counter seem to fit the limitations required by government. Plus, facial masks on everyone I can see behind the counter and at the door when I request delivery. Even so, I'd really like to see the front space get an uplift with paint, furnishings and less decor.   Still, they are OPEN. That's enough to keep me happy with a local place I can rely on for in store pick up and door delivery. My fave dishes are always on the menu and taste good each time I order."

China Cafe,New York,Manlius,Reginald Cannon,4,Friendly service both for take put and dining in. I recommend calling in your order if taking out. It saves the wait on the weekend.

Ordered shrimp fries rice and of course they put six on top because none are at the bottom. For an extra dollar at that. Reminds me why I like places like China cafeteria and miss them. O and not to forget I asked for only onions and got onions peas and carrots didn't want to wait for them to redo the order so will just take my business elsewhere.

China King,Virginia,Fairfax,C M2201pts,2,"Had been a long time Chinese favorite as food was at least average, but something has changed since my last visit of more than two months ago.  Yesterday I ordered one of the dinner entrees with plain fried rice (this type of rice specifically is listed on their online menu).  In the past, this was tasty brown rice.  When my order was completed yesterday, I was given white rice.  Trying to correct the error with the lady behind the counter, I explained to her what I received in the past ordering the same type of rice, and I was even willing to pay extra for it.  No go - she indicated to me they no longer serve fried rice which I find to hard to believe, so I was stuck with sticky white rice which even soy sauce not to my tasting was going to fix.  I understand if a business makes an error on occasion (we're all human and not perfect), but one she should have told me when I placed the order they no longer served the fried rice so I could substitute another side with my meal, and two it is bad when a business does not try to make it right as best they can when an error occurs.  As with this type of business (Chinese), if you are English speaking, communication can be difficult at best if something not goes right, and this business is no different.  I won't be back (so no go from here) unless amends are made, and China King for now sadly is on Santa's naughty business list."

Taste of Asia,Virginia,Roanoke,Corey O'Shaughnessy (Seeker),5,"Great pan-Asian restaurant in Roanoke. Quick service (even on a Friday night) and excellent portion sizes. (Note: if you're used to American ""bigger is better"" meals, portion sizes will disappoint you; they're typical Asian sizes but I've never left there hungry.) Atmosphere is casual and relaxing, and there is a bar. The restaurant overall is pricey. Any dinner (Japanese, Chinese, Thai) is $10 - $20. Appetizers run $5 - $10. No Vietnamese food on the menu. Meals are excellent and well-presented. You're greeted with warm towels and a very friendly server! If you're not good with chopsticks, no need to be embarrassed; a fork is provided at the table. I strongly recommend the Thunder Shrimp and any of their sushi, sashimi, or nigiri. Super place for a date!"

There lo mein had some weird taste/smell , it tastes sort of like finger nail Polish remover smells. All in all eat a pb&j it's a much better option. There is nothing personal going on here, it's just really that bad. I spent $30.00, and every bit of it still sits in my fridge.

Cozy booths with individual pots are encircled by a very sleek conveyor belt delivering a great selection of veggies. There‚Äôs also a well stocked buffet with meats and seafoods. The sauce bar is compact but with a nice choice of condiments. The server was happy to adjust the broth to individual tastes and they do have vegetarian broth options. The service was very fast and competent, quick to remove plates and offer suggestions. Everything was delicious, and there were lots of items I‚Äôd never seen at hotpot before like brains and frog legs. I do wish the tofu variety had been wider, but they carry the fried puffs which is a personal favorite."

While it's not my number one favorite Chinese restaurant, it's one that I've recommended to people that lived nearby and wanted good food. My only complaint, and I know it's because they stay so busy, is the customer service is very quick and short. Customers want to know their orders are in good care and appreciate a little bit of extra time taken. That being said, as of this writing, we're amid a pandemic and these little things are hard to accomplish at this time. Therefore, I give a 5 star review."

But what really makes this rating is that they put all these heavy, piping hot items, leaking juices, gravy, and steam everywhere, in a single layer paper bag with no bottom board, resulting in the bag giving way after 5 minutes, spilling the containers and aforementioned juices and gravy all over the ground and my feet."

Nicely decorated but average food, friendly staff and quick service, the waiter kept refilling our tea all the time and cleaning the table which was great.
I recommend getting the duck egg fried rice, stir fry intestines, and string beans. The boil was skippable, not that flavorful. There was a lot of space when we went, not too busy. They also have a room on the side that's good for a small party. Could be an option to try if other restaurants have a long wait time in the area."

P.F. Chang's,North Carolina,Durham,Cassandra,1,"As soon as you walked into the restaurant the first thing I noticed was trash on the benches in the waiting area. Waited about 10 minutes to be seated which wasn‚Äôt bad. As we were being taken to our table it was trash everywhere on the carpet, just around our table alone was several straw wrappers, napkins , and old food on the floor. It looked as if the staff hadn‚Äôt cleaned after each guest all day long. Our waitress came out quickly to take our drink order and put in the appetizer. Took forever to get the chicken lettuce wraps . We had to take silverware from another table because we weren‚Äôt given any. Another long wait for the main course to arrive and it was disappointing. I got the shrimp lo mein and my noodles were so over cooked that they tasted like mush. The shrimp were overcooked and the whole dish had very little sauce. We also ordered the steak and potatoes after seeing how good it looked from the table beside us, well ours didn‚Äôt come out that way it looked like everything was just thrown on the plate and the potatoes were undercooked. The food was not even sliced it was big chunks. Awful dining experience!!"
Panda House,Virginia,Madison Heights,David Hammer,1,Horrible selection of food. Terrible taste and very dry. Not the same it was years ago
Grand Asia Market,North Carolina,Raleigh,Marsha Adkins,3,"The store is stocked! The products are always organized, however,  I wish there was more signage and better signage. There is very very little in English. And unfortunately it is difficult to get any help in there, because it's not always clear who works there. I have only encountered one employee in the many years I've been shopping there, who would speak to me in English and answer a question. ONE.
If they don't want non-asian speakers to use their store, I wish they would just put up a sign telling me that! I keep shopping there, because there are things I want to get there and their prices are good. The bakery is lovely."

Gaga Seafood Restaurant,Massachusetts,Boston,David Mongeau-Petitpas,2,"I tried to order something, the waiter came back and told me it was not available so he pointed me a special on the wall written only in Chinese. I said okay. Got a half chicken plate, all cut out in total chaos. The chicken was boiled with all the fat and skin mixed with it. I usually like fat and skin, but boiled, it was absolutely terrible. I mean, the taste of the chicken meat was okay, but the task of trying to remove all the squeechy fat and skin made it disgusting. That's what you get when you don't know other culture well and go to an unknown restaurant in the China Town."
Noodle Box,Virginia,Alexandria,Elizabeth Hutz,5,"We love the Pad Thai here so much that we‚Äôve started ordering the platter for 4. It‚Äôs amazing. We‚Äôve tried the drunken noodle dish as well, but the Pad Thai is hard to beat."

Jasmine Buffet,South Carolina,Columbia,Matt L,3,"I've been here multiple times, and usually it's my favorite Chinese buffet around.

But since they reopened, it just doesn't seem quite the same. The selection is a bit limited compared to what it used to be, and the quality of what is available doesn't seem as high anymore. I went to pick up a steamed dumpling with the tongs, and it was literally rock-hard... I have no idea how long they had been sitting there; I put it right back down.

It wasn't exactly bad overall (much of what I had tonight still ranged from okay to good), and maybe I just caught them on an off night, but it definitely didn't seem as good as it used to be."

The Original Buddha Bodai Kosher Vegetarian Restaurant ü•¨ ‰ΩõËè©Êèê,New York,New York,Sir Bernard Mendes France,5,"One of NYC's great 'kosher' vegetarian places to eat-in, and dine on Chinese dim sum delicacies. A very popular eatery that serves a wide-array of Chinese standard fare menu favorites of all varieties. All as tasty and delicious as the original dishes. The a/c gives an exceptional ambiance during the summer months and really honest home-runs with the anytime takeout for the weekday or weekend.

This establishment is completely „Ääcertified kosher„Äãkeeping its many patrons happy and those who love to indulge in a good Brunch -- Hong Kong-style to start the day !"
Mr. Rice,New Jersey,Rahway,Giant Pants,5,"Normally i don't comment on Chinese food because the quality these days is lacking and most of the food is pre-frozen, or those who use to do great food just lost their edge with age. The heart of cooking is lost to apathy, but not Mr Rice.

Mr Rice is in a class to itself, it's true Chinese cuisine at its best the kinds of flavors you will get from a very good chef in NY the same flavors i use to get as a child in the 70's,
Each morsel is prepared with care. The presentation is pleasing to the eye and pleasure to the pallet.

The young man that delivered our food recommended the shrimp toast, usually i avoid it lake a plague, they actually took the time and made it there along with hand rolled spring rolls. The flavor was amazing and it was cooked all the way though. All I'm talking about is shrimp toast.
So you can imagine how the food is.

I've ordered from them twice at home and once at work in Edison, the foods quality is the best around bar none. I just hope we can keep this palace a secret before mean people start bringing down the grace and positive attributes that are currently Mr Rice.

I highly recommend Mr Rice they are way above the rest. Don't tell anyone about this little slice of heaven in Rahway, places like this is very hard to find."

Kwai Lam Kitchen,New Jersey,Newark,Joshua South,5,"No, really! It is. We happened to arrive just as Portugal was beating France in the finals and the place was alive. A waiter spotted us at the door and guided us through the crowd at the bar to a small dining room and we spent the rest of the evening in his hands. He brought us food that may or may not have been on the menu- a boiled whitefish with vegetables that he served wrapped in a napkin with a boiled egg tucked inside. He lightly covered it with olive oil ( so good, we went to buy some at the market). When we ordered a flan with two spoons, he brought us two flans ( because tonight I have two different kinds and you should try them both and tell me which you like better). Don't miss places like this when you come to the Ironbound."

It is not comparable to the bridge noodles I have eaten in Yunnan, but in so many bridge noodles I have eaten in New York it is already very good and has its own taste. When you serve it, you can eat it directly, without having to add side dishes yourself. Cold salad is not good, the taste is single! !! The spring onion cakes are very large, but they are too oily! !! Good service and clean environment! Next time I go again, I will just cross the bridge noodles.

Or customers.
You lost  $125.00 in sales , went to China 1 and got my order done without a problem and order lunch  and drinks for 10 people only 3 entrees I need it to be with vegetables and The Sweet and sour sauce substitution, it as an easy fix, we will not order from panda express ever again.

I've never done hotpots and there was no explanation of how long to cook things, how to get the base into my bowl (ladels had holes), or recommendations.

Four Four South Village,New York,Queens,Sophia Calderone,4,"Comforting soups with great chewy noodles and a soup base that reads like a clean tasting younger sibling of a richer broth. Maybe a dollar or two higher than it could be but in Manhattan it'd be priced aight and no one would bat an eye. Satisfying portion. Lacks the pretentiousness of manhattan. Great for giving yourself a space to feel safe with some soup.

If you like cozy unassuming places. Low-key comfort food. And feel like a weary traveller. I think you'll find a sense of safety and comfort in eating here. I definitely can see myself coming back here if I was in the area to try some of their other dishes."

We notice the changes being made over there and I wanted to show my support. Keep up the good work. There is a big difference between a fast food restaurant and Chinese food restaurant. That is why the 88 stands out. You changed the way I felt about the whole Chinese fast food restaurant belief. You are actually a high end Chinese restaurant who caters to your customers and their every desire.

Several pieces did not even have chicken inside of them, so basically we paid for fried dough?  Everything else we had was also poor quality.  The kids didn't even want to eat it.  We normally order from Wok & Roll.  There food is always fresh and much higher quality.  The food we tried to eat tonight makes the food court Chinese restaurants look gourmet.  I hate leaving a bad review but folks it was that bad.  Go elsewhere."

China Chef Restaurant,New York,Batavia,Steven Oller,3,"Dinner time on Sunday night and I thought I would try the other Chinese buffet near work. Tucked in the corner of a strip center near a busy intersection China Chef was surprisingly quiet. The $9.99 price for the buffet was also surprising (I have paid almost twice as much). Then I  discovered the reasons. The buffet was tiny. One steam table, one salad/dessert table,  and one bread/pastry table. Two soups. Almost no shrimp and very little beef. A little bit of sushi that looked prepackaged. What wasn't dried out tasted very good. And the service was excellent. My tea never ran out. Perhaps another day it would be a good choice. Not today."

Jasmine Buffet,South Carolina,Columbia,Konan smith,2,Jasmine Buffet always looks like it's busy. The restaurant is not too bad as far as cleanliness.

Wanted to just drive over there and pick it up since I only live a mile away, but they said it was already out for delivery.  40 minutes later, our food arrived.

Chef Wu,Georgia,Roswell,Dante,3,"Hey, Georgia food guide here!

Chef Wu's general tsos chicken is their best selling point from what I've had today. It uses the correct sauce and has a slight crunch to it and a hint of orange citrus.

The scallion bubble pancake is missing the experience factor (it's precut into small triangular slices) and it was also far too soft which caused it to become floppy, normally this dish should be incredibly crispy and tear away from itself with some resistance.

Lastly, the soup buns we had were the worst part of the experience unfortunately. They tasted as if they were frozen and had a somewhat off flavor. Once we saw them we immediately noticed how un-appealing they were as they were small and shriveled. I've had some seriously good soup dumplings in georgia but unfortunately this isn't even remotely close to hitting the mark."

New Dragon,New York,Flushing,max lee,1,"Well...some of their menu are average. But most of them are below average. For example, one of our favorite food such as general tso's chicken or sesame chicken doesn't have any single vegi like broccoli ( i am not vegi person. don't get me wrong) it's only too much fried chicken with same sauce with rice only. Nothing else. Their shredded beef and Chow fun are definitely not recommended too."

House of Lu,New York,Bellmore,Ameet Jayawant,1,"Bad business practice to not trust what a customer says. Will not use this place again. We have been ordering from this place for a number of years. Today, when my wife tasted the Mei Fun it tasted smoky and burnt. There were even some burnt noodles in the container. I called the owner to let him know of this and his response was very unusual. He informed me that he spoke to his wife - who apparently does all the cooking - and she said that the Mei Fun ""is good"", hence it is not his problem. He refused to listen to my complaint. I informed him that we will not be ordering from him again. He did not seem alarmed, on the contrary he said ""that is ok""."

CON: I agree with another reviewer where they were overcharged for their food. I too was over charged. It is the principal of being honest in business especially when it comes to weight of food. Its sad these men are willing to cheat you several dollars over. It makes me sick to my stomach when you trust people and they take advantage of it. Will not be back,"

I like that they offer some combo plates for $6.50 which I order to last me for 2 days at work. I also order their vegetable soup which is a light option when you don't want to have a heavy meal late at night. One might be put off by the glass that separates the customers from the workers but the food is good. I find that they offer less items than some other Chinese food spots I've been to but, I guess it goes according to what the community orders."

Yunshang Rice Noodle House,New York,Brooklyn,Elsa C,5,"Yunnan style rice noodle (crossing the bridge noodles)
You can choose your own flavor of soup base, and they will serve you a big plate with all little dishes.
After they serve hot boil soup, you start to put in all into the bowl.

We had original flavor, the broth is cook over 12 hours. It's rich and flavorful but not too salty. Really really good. The rice noodle is much soft then regular noodle. Totally different than ramen noodle. Match really well with the soup. And I like they have 1-2 pieces of little things.

And today is cold, windy, and raining. It just the perfect time for this hot noodle soup. Defiantly coming back soon!"

I was very disappointed by this experience overall."

When they accidentally made a mistake and gave us the wrong plate of food, they asked if they should take it back and change it out for the correct one.  When my mom said no, that it was okay, they did not even charge us for that dish!  My mom also said that the tofu was the best she ever had.  I  usually hate tofu (no offense to the tofu lovers out there) but I decided to try it. If they can get me to like something that I usually would not, then I would recommend their restaurant  to everyone, and that is what I am doing right now!  Their fries have a thin, crispy layer  around them, and a soft inside. This restaurant certainly deserves 5 stars."

P.F. Chang's,Virginia,Newport News,Betsy Jimenez,1,"I would have giving this place 5 stars because the first time I went food was excellent and service was great. The only issue I had was when I ordered the surf and turf that came the asparagus. I was only served asparagus bottoms which were inedible.  The problem was quickly fixed whenthe waitress brought me out a plate of asparagus sauteed in a delicious butter and garlic sauce.  We loved it so much  we decided to make it our regular spot to dine as we dine about 4 to 5 times a week.  On our second visit we ordered the same thing.  My husband was still in his work clothes and we felt instantly judged for this. We waited 40 minutes for shrimp dumplings that were cold. We waited an hour and a half for surf and turf that were well done (we asked for medium rare) I asked for a manager (Larry) who took his time coming over to us.. now by this time the table behind us had already been seated twice. The second couple that sat down to eat was complaining that they waiting 40 minutes for a shrimp dinner meanwhile they were the second couple to sit there to dine and we still had not had our dinner.  Larry  without hesitation tells them that dinner is on him much to their liking.  When he gets to our table.  I show him our food because, yet again we are served all asparagus bottoms well done steak and he looks at as like we have two head and asks what would we like for him to do? I tried very hard to hold my composure and I tell him, I would like for him to give me what I am paying for which is 2 medium rare surf and turf dinners with asparagus tips not bottoms. I tell him that we are not looking for a free meal we are looking for what we are paying for.
We wait another 45 minutes. Mind you... He personally took our food back and put in our food order. What I got back was well done beef Flambeau no asparagus no shrimp.  By this time I am very hangry another manager comes out says she will put in a togo order for me of med well surf and turf she says she will order me a side of asparagus abd see what she can comp. Then the host comes up to give us two $25 gift cards which we were reluctant to take but took them in the end. She was extremely apologetic and worked hard to defuse the situation and was successful. Something both managers failed to do. Why she isn't in management is beyond me.

My asparagus comes. It was not cooked in anything.  They were thrown in the pot as is. They weren't even thrown in with oil they were still hard un cut by this time I was disgusted. Waitress brings me my to go food, I ask her about my comp. I wait another 10 minutes for slow loris Larry to make it back to our table,  by this time we are there well over three hours  and tge only yhong we have eaten was shrimp dumplings and our drinks.
This man has the audacity to comp our dinners only! Not our appetizers nor our drinks because we actually ate and drank those,  meanwhile the couple behind us who were non Hispanic and only waiting 40 minutes for their dinner had their entire bill comped no questions asked. I processed to become unhinged at this point and demand that he comp the entire bill which he does. The bill was a total of $92 which I turn around and tip its entirety to my server. A very nice young lady here while in college. We are given our togo bags we get back home I check my bag we have one surf and turf well done again.  We never ate it and we gave away tge gift cards. I would never recomend this place ever.
My husband and I are foodies we travel the US and we dine anywhere frim 5 star restaurants to street food. We have been to the best of the best to the worst of the worst. Sadly PF Changs is the Worst of the worst. I would never fathom of trying to get free food from anyone.  We felt judged,  we felt humiliated and most of all we felt like Larry simply thought we were looking for a free meal. This man is not fit to manage a white castle let alone  a restaurant that carries a name such  as P.F Changs."

Mandarin Chinese Halal Restaurant,Virginia,Springfield,Zainub Aftab,5,"Taste is really good but the only issue is that if you have left overs and it's anything but soup and u ask to put it In plastic containers, they charge you for it, and they offer to pack it in foil but that still leaks. That's very annoying.
Plus 6 people plus they charge 20%gratuity even if there are kids in the group"

China Palace,Maryland,Havre De Grace,Jeffrey Watters,5,"I order my home delivery Chinese food from China Palace.  I once ordered from China Kitchen and regretted it.  Both places have good food, but China Palace is authentic Asian cuisine.  Some of the reviews say this place is a dump.  It is!  It is a dump with the best Chinese food anywhere in the area.  Just like good seafood comes from the most unlikely dives on the wharf, the best Chinese food comes from this place, the China Palace. If you want expensive Chinese food prepared by the nicest, most presentable place go to Lin's, it's okay, if you want great Chinese food, call China Palace."

Great Wall Chinese Restaurant,Virginia,Stuarts Draft,Jessi Ulrich,3,"ORIGINAL STARS : 1 star

So far I have tried to order delivery twice from them. Yesterday, 1/10/17, they said they couldn't deliver at all and today said that they couldn't deliver till 9pm. It is currently almost 4pm and I find this distasteful. Why even bother having a delivery service if you don't seem to deliver? I will update later tonight on how the food is. I hope for their sake that it is good.

EDIT : They delivered my food at 8:30 because I called again and asked if they could come earlier than 9. I ordered Curry Chicken and Spring Rolls. The Spring Rolls are amazing and so is the Curry Chicken. I wouldn't have thought they could redeem themselves, but they did.  Amazing food. Only thing is it was delivered by an 8 year old boy. I will be contacting the BBB."
Imperial Dynasty Chinese and Japanese Cuisine,Florida,Longwood,Ben Shoup,5,excellent fast service
King Chinese Buffet,North Carolina,Garner,Chris Brocksmith,2,Gone downhill since I was there 9 months ago.
Chopstick Express,Florida,St. Petersburg,Lauren,4,"I was apprehensive at first, but wanted to give it a shot. As far as convenience goes, you can‚Äôt beat it. Pull through their drive thru and in under 10 minutes your meal is hot and in your car. The sushi in the past has been pretty good and the food, as well. They do have vegan options but are not very accommodating with the prices of them. Very overpriced compared to the ‚Äúusual‚Äù fare they sell. Will update to 5 stars if they start integrating tofu as a meal option."

Ms.Cathy served us in  a timely manner while working her way around the  room tending to other customers.

Old Shanghai Soup Dumplings,New Jersey,Palisades Park,Scott Cohen,5,"This place is an amazing place for delicious juicy flavorful Soup Dumplings. But its not just the Dumplings, everything on the menu I have tried has been delicious. I have been here numerous times in the past few weeks, 3 work lunches and one weekend lunch with a friend.  After 4 visits , I can conclude that there is consistency in my visits.
The place does well with COVID spreading diners out and forcing all that enter to have their temperature taken.
The Wait staff is very attentive, on my last visit the manager came to the table to assist with the order. And some times it's the small unnoticed stuff that the wait staff can do that makes a difference, like taking the time to pack up the boxes with our left overs rather than just dropping containers off at the table, My glass of tea was always at least half full, because they came and filled it often
The portions are large and well priced, I do not think anything is overpriced on the menu. I always feel like I get good a good value when I go here
With a large menu with many choices this is a perfect place for soup dumplings and many other dishes.
My favorite items on the menu
Steamed crab meat and pork Soup Dumplings
Hot and Sour Soup
Sesame Chicken
beef with Chile peppers... This is a bit spicy but so good!"
Cajun Seafood,Florida,Hollywood,Jennifer Gutierrez,5,Best food .

Just about every Chinese restaurant I have tried  from Glens falls to Plattsburgh is just nasty slop, I took a chance driving by Asian delight am so glad I did, The food is just like NYC Chinese take out... the real deal!!

If I don't have other place I can go, I would come back again. Only bad thing about this restaurant is that they cant handle when there is more people keeps coming in. Everything become chaotic when is there is more people. They don't have a process when people start to sit down and order food. My food came out at random order. It is a bit over priced for the quality of the food that they offer."

Taste of China,New Jersey,Belleville,A Paradise,1,"Taste of China Chinese Restaurant (take out) - 573 Belleville Ave., Belleville, NJ Review

It is sad to say, that in this time of restaurants, especially local ones, having such a hard time due to the Covid-19 Coronavirus Pandemic, one would think a restaurant, Especially a small local Chinese restaurant like Taste¬†of China at 573 Belleville Ave., Belleville, NJ , would do all they could to keep and at least make a customer happy,¬†Especially a loyal¬†and frequent one.

We ordered a few take out/to go meals in Oct. 2020 and 2 had scouring/brillo pad metal pieces mixed in the meals!
When we brought this very upsetting, disturbing and disgusting concern to the owners/managers, after their many back and forth arguments with their¬†cooks/coworkers in Chinese, they came back to us and acted oblivious. Not even an apology!¬† They very reluctantly offered to remake the meals but they Insisted on us returning the Contaminated meals to them (or what was left of them). As we have been regular patrons of this restaurant, we obliged.

To add insult to injury, a week later when we tried to order from them¬†again, they rudely attempted¬†to explain, in very poor broken English, that because we did not want metal scouring pad pieces in our food, they would not sell to us anymore and hung up on us!

As there are Much better, Cleaner, Friendlier and Appreciative local Chinese restaurants around Belleville, Bloomfield, Nutley and Montclair, NJ, we can No longer, in good conscience, recommend Taste¬†of China at 573 Belleville Ave.,  Belleville, NJ anymore."

If you're looking for a place with great Hispanic food, this is the place to go! Their menu is ridiculously diverse with so many options that it might probably take you a lot of visits for you to be able to try everything. I highly recommend this place as it will be good for the lone ranger, for the family oriented and even for business meetings. The truth is that after my first experience with this place I decided to try it again and after doing so I really thought about the old adage that says that everyone deserves a second chance. I believe that their second chance paid off as both my wife and myself were very satisfied. Bottom line is that you won't be disappointed!!!"

They have an All you can eat Korean BBQ for $19.99 but its only for an hour and a half which is short because they purposefully slow cook for you and you don't end up eating a lot nor satisfied before you leave which sucks because who doesn't want to have a stomach at least half full before leaving an All you can eat place. Personally lived in Flushing for over 9 years to know this.

The shrimps were also not well done ( a little too crunchy lol). Packaging was below average for a resturant that's been in business for this long. Utensils were not included although the order was for rice. I don't think ADDING UTENSILS  should be an option when something as such is being ordered.
Hot Wok,Virginia,Staunton,Teresa Spray,5,Love it.

With that came changes...changes that I didn't like. Finally tonight I spoke with the new owner...he promised me I would love it and guess what??? I did.

The General Tso's chicken is back to be spicy...each thing we ordered was delicious and had its own special seasoning...which is terrific. Though I would suggest that they learn how to fry the dumplings better.

Over all I'd give it an A. And if they can get the fried dumplings correct...they'll be back up to A+ in no time at all. Delivery was expedient also, which was a nice change too. :) So thank you Rice Box. You won back one of your customers. :)"

Foo Chow Restaurant,New York,Richfield Springs,Jerry S.,2,First time ever to this place. (Couple weeks ago; about middle of September 2020) Food was not very fresh or tasty.

My husband asked them to throw in fried wontons (3.- dollar item) wife got nasty and started to yell , we told her forget the order and I went elsewhere. My point,  customers come first. Service is key.  Then she has the nerve to call back and ask if we want the order after we told her forget it. Not comfortable ordering take out from someone who is already upset and nasty.

Buddakan,New York,New York,Danny Surujbali,3,"A trendy, staple Asian fusion restaurant/bar within the city that‚Äôs great for groups or to take a date. The space is modern and spacious but can be pretty loud, service is superb/attentive and the food is a modern take on Asian Fusion. I love Asian food, and I frequently eat in The Chinatowns in both Flushing and Manhattan so I am a bit bias. However, if the Chinatowns with hole in the wall restaurants are not your thing, then Buddakan might be a better option as the food is more modern and American."

P.F. Chang's,Virginia,Newport News,Jesse G.,1,"Waited for every service asked. First off we ordered strawberry ginger margaritas, they took forever to arrive. There was sooo much ice in the COCKTAIL glass, after i finished it my guess was it was about 1/3 full when it was first made. Next was the menu. My son is allergic to nuts and all dairy products. There was not one piece of meat for him to select. The manager said ALL meats are pre-marinated in milk or egg mixtures. All he could offer was broccoli, snap peas, carrots etc. During this time my wife said they were celebrating my birthday. We decided to switch to a blackberry spice martini which was made with rum - which gives me bad indigestion. I thought martinis were made with gin or vodka... If I knew rum was in it, I would have ordered something else. I suffered for about 45 min after finishing it. The dinner was good except for one other thing besides my son wanting something he couldn't have. The continued wait!!! Our server I think was ""JC"" - very nice fella but he couldn't remember anything. My son ketchup came 20 min into the meal. my wife ate about a 1/4 of her meal, I had enough to take home but opted not to. My son hardly ate any of his ""bland veggie"" dish. We asked the manager for to go containers. his reply.. I'll get the server to get them. The containers were less than 5 feet behind him at this point. SO, we waited. When the server came with a spread of mini desserts. My daughter got the triple chocolate happiness - 3 spoonfuls and it was gone. about 15 minutes JC arrived with the bill, we asked him for the containers, he left and we waited. upon his return we presented him with a coupon. JC said I have to re-ring up the bill, so we waited, and waited, and waited. When he returned, I was so ready to go, but guess what, he placed the food in containers while my wife signed the bill. As she handed JC the card to pay, another employee arrived and said here is your complimentary birthday banana spring roll and coconut ice cream. This seemed a bit late; I'm really ready to go at this point so I ate a spoonful or two while we WAITED for the card.

The restaurant was not that busy, and it is my opinion that ALL food should not be pre-marinated as described, a proper allergy menu should be available, and there should be a better kids menu. Lastly, margaritas are not served in a cocktail glass!"

I will never return for not greeting me, not asking me am I ready to order, answering the phone with out saying please give me a moment to place this customer on hold so I can take your order and also not thanking me after I paid and received my food to leave the place of business. Maybe she was having a bad day and she was taking out on me but I would never know because I will never return. Good luck."

China Palace Restaurant,Georgia,Marietta,Peggy Lemear,1,"I used to order from here all the time years ago. My hubby got me the
sweet&sour chicken dinner combo on June 7th for my birthday. It was the nastiest food ever. The chicken was so dry and over cooked I couldn't even chew it. The ""fried rice "" was white rice mixed with soy sauce, and the egg roll was way under cooked.. I would not recommend  this place at all. On an up note my dogs loved
it"

Panda Cafe,Virginia,Manassas,ccakes cc,5,"The food is great. I only once had a bad experience with the younger delivery guy. We order here all the time. As well, as eat here..Btw, you have to order at the counter first for those with complaints of waiting. They'll serve your food to your table if you order in.  They generally have more deliveries  & pick-ups.

One person however does not ruin the quality of their food or the other people. The owner and manager both were very kind. They went above expectation to apologize to us after the incident. We will continue to eat here of course. Best chinese food in Manassas. I highly recommend them!"
China Taste,Virginia,Powhatan,Teri Carr,5,Ownership has changed it's still yummy.  Even if it's not on the menu they can make it. You have to try the ragoons!
